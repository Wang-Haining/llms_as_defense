            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where the landscape transitions from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Any destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most picturesque areas in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful and easily accessible for a quick visit. My neighborhood embodies the small-town spirit. The houses are not densely packed nor are they identical; instead, they are older homes, some renovated and others retaining their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses feature older aluminum siding, and you can find homes in every color imaginable around mine. Most residences have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some people maintain gardens, while others have fenced areas for their pets. The houses reflect the character of Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, and people are often out walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize and greet each other, identifying those who belong and those who do not. It's common to see someone grilling outside or to exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left from autumn. The green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are trimmed. Although not a neighborhood that impresses with upscale homes, it conveys a sense of being a great place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While its appearance is average, it stands out for embodying what people desire most: a secure place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department adjacent. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving both neighbors and city residents. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is nearby, and the sound of small planes taking off and landing is familiar whether you're inside or out. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, downtown is within reach from our residential area. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice nothing but well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards all look quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see small trees as well. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved concrete. Although many different families live here, the roads are in excellent condition, free from potholes and the like. Most houses are single-story, though you'll occasionally see two-story ones as well. We don't have the usual mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, similar to apartments. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, the HOA and their focus on uniformity are to thank for this. My house is located at the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood is partly rural and partly suburban. This provides us with plenty of land for various purposes. There are several community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough for running around to get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. Alongside them, there's a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect and rely on. For example, we have one mall, which isn't huge but serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, I find a wide variety of stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with a limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have many nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn't right next door, a short drive will take you to any major chain you desire.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast discussing missing persons. It was somewhat surprising, as nearly every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars monthly. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Perhaps it's about the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You begin to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes with mothball odors. You notice smells less as an adult. You may start smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. But the flea market is always distinct. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It settles into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores nearby. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. Regardless of how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon, and more of those afternoons come each year as the city grows. Cars and people flood the area. It's a developing city, known for hosting one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it still faces growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you like, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's an energetic place to be. With the pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, our apartment is less about strangers and more about a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help when needed. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. I deliver their mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, but it's neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban fringe of a major city. My neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by people with low incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are usually friendly and often greet me with a smile when I pass by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks in the last decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Last year, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Luckily, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item vanishing from our porch if left outside. Overall, my town has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many parts of the U.S., with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources in the town to address this crisis, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these issues, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying due to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to an inability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most improvements have been focused on the town center and the west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options, both small businesses and large retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be very valuable, but it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and set on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down from my place, there's a trendy arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up the hill is the closest city park, which is quite large given its location. The park is encircled by concrete with tall stairs built into the walls. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy winter rains make it challenging to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than on the outskirts, they can keep warmer. They're also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can wash and shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I cherish about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even thirty years later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher neighborhoods, the locals strive to maintain its cleanliness and care deeply about their city and block. There's an old warning that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning harks back to the past and is tinged with social conditioning. Maybe I blend in enough to not be seen as completely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the societal issues that linger nationwide. These reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance persist, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel invigorated walking its streets at night, encountering people more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open longer so I could charge my phone when I had no shelter from the rain. It's where I've sat, thinking myself invisible, only for someone to notice, hand me $5, and remind me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but eventually, I became close with someone who lived two houses away and another friend from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I can hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the neighbors, and you're generally left in peace unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose during football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy swings and slides. The park now brings a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of food options within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food is popular, as in most suburbs, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, such as an Indian-owned store for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I really enjoy my neighborhood. Reading about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently changed its name and has become pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly college students and lower-income individuals, as the apartments are relatively cheap. There's an elementary school nearby, so there are many children around. Although I don't interact with my neighbors, I'm not inclined to either. They smoke a lot of marijuana, prompting management to place an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly insulting. The buildings nearby typically appear old but may have updated interiors. A short distance away, new apartments have been constructed, but I don't favor them due to their poor construction and high rent, which I view as a rip-off justified by their proximity to campus. Close by is a very affordable restaurant that serves food on paper plates and mostly reheats it in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station that reportedly isn’t a great place to work. Recently, the city improved the road, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but it's still more wooded than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street behind it is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and run-down buildings. The abundance of trees there likely serves to conceal the buildings' condition. Most crime in the area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but there are also issues with crime and a transient population in the apartments across from me. Despite this, I like my neighborhood. It's affordable and conveniently located, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby, making trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They are scattered and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow, has white porches, and features green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of an unassigned driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This experience is a refreshing break from the modern world's focus on technology and computers. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies and fluffy clouds. The only drawback this season is the tornado warnings. Last night, for the first time, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my bigger dog refused to come into the bathroom, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road steamed due to the temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees within minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the warm pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I hurried inside to grab my camera and captured the scene to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooking. This neighborhood is very welcoming for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else here. Although all the houses look identical on the outside, the apartments differ inside, with some being surprisingly small. It puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which is not meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a large bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like residing in a small village community. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. I was fortunate to discover this delightful neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for around 10 years, I think I can share my experiences. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I was quite sad. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was tough, and I cried because I missed my old friends and loved ones. However, my parents wanted a better environment for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and a nicer high school, far from what we considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends and some enemies at school. I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value them. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyous occasion. I caught the garter, but missed the bouquet! We danced all night, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, although I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I explore it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis to play video games and make the most of life. I find peace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and occasionally bring my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, despite the hard work. I've had many enjoyable moments here, and while these are some highlights, I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not be distinctive among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as highlighted on its welcome sign. The area is mainly made up of farmland with peach trees or cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart; most are two-story with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or have gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing for front fields used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are found. For \"fast food,\" you can choose between Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There was once a pizzeria, but it closed recently. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's small, pricey grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Despite being the sole grocery store, many residents only buy a few items there, preferring to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known community member, which has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Attached to this store is a pet grooming facility, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's office and veterinary practice are located outside the town center; both are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there are no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might pass through without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's a generally quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. Neighbors mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located on the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars people drive around here. We tend to notice unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes as you might expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and me. So, I imagine others are used to seeing us come and go, too. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, which fills the air with a pleasant aroma. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March until around October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees because it was originally a wooded area, providing plenty of shade, but also an abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a nice indicator that fall has arrived. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, it's quite peaceful here. Thanksgiving brings some visiting families, and extra cars are parked everywhere, similar to other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a lawn, you know the owner is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely scattered. It's still largely the same, but there have been many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to resemble a city more and more each day, though I suppose that's a common trend everywhere. While most people here are quite friendly, just like any city, there are good areas and bad ones. I live in a neighborhood surrounded by welcoming elderly folks, so it's probably one of the nicer areas. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale options, you have to travel a bit; there aren't any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, though this is just my observation and not based on official statistics. This might be because the city is still underdeveloped, with lots of open land left to build on, which worries me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and have no desire to return. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field—I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here is the variety of wildlife. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert's climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these non-human neighbors to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, all of whom are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun, the Victorville way. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that tell the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I have a somewhat distinct perspective. Unlike many who might describe their neighborhoods as homeowners with separate lives, my experience is a bit different. I see the college campus where I reside as my neighborhood, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also view the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area before delving into them. There are three main housing options nearby: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with each floor containing about 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 residents each. The standalone houses are available for rent by those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom configurations. These houses are few and scattered, as they are less space-efficient. Lastly, the dormitories, which are the most prevalent, house hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room, with some exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the residents. My school prides itself on diversity, reflected in the cultural and age variety of those living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff reside in the on-campus houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so let’s discuss the shops and parks. My school functions as a self-sufficient neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's own branded clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, anything needed is accessible within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse residents and is kept clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. My house is perched atop the steepest hill around, which slopes downward. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" because it's popular with joggers as part of their exercise routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians use the road, which has a few potholes that make driving a bit risky. Some telephone and power lines in the area look ragged due to frequent storms that knock down branches and debris, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere, but residents often cut them down to enhance the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay's scenery. The view is stunning at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, though it's mostly cloudy, making the sunlight appear through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, with moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. There aren't many children here, despite a nearby school; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often seen in yards or running down the street, sometimes sneaking into open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to guide it outside. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in our neighborhood. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, along with the occasional hawk or eagle, until they are chased off by crows. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is a popular way to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. As you explore, be ready to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll come across an Asian-owned store nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly common. These businesses are favored by locals because they offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are very convenient. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping very convenient. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for summer fun. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds enjoying them. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family houses. People here are generally nice but can be quite noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which might wake you up. If you visit at night, stay alert. While the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, and package theft is a recent issue. Although New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, many people here disregard this rule. Every morning, you'll likely spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is seeing dog waste everywhere, so watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The city's unofficial motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes skirting the law—says \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this serves as a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a city less famous and costly, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weirdness here doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what is usually not accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of the nation, most of what we purchase comes from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. The city has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take everything a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, we have vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes during summer. Free boxes, typically cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items someone no longer wants, often containing a perfect treasure for a passerby. They usually have clothes and books, but can include anything. The enchanting experience of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me—though I'm just one among many types of weird here. Some locals wouldn't dream of choosing clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might attend goat yoga (yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is filled with people who love diverse things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream of doing so while spending excessive time at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which often stems from mental health issues exacerbated by the frequent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, but these are inadequate, much like elsewhere in the country. Residents' attitudes towards the homeless fluctuate between compassion and disdain, making us not so weird in this aspect.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun’s path at every dawn and dusk. Even when I overlook them, distracted by work and life, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand attention, and when I finally notice them, they offer solace to my anxious mind, giving me the strength to continue, one day at a time. I moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were the first to capture my attention. The university is also filled with stunning sights—buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured my heart—but the mountains reign supreme. The rest of the town has its own beauty. There are numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride downtown reveals an old-world charm with faded colored bricks adorning the restaurants and office buildings, where the town matches the hustle of its neighboring city. This lively atmosphere only spans a few blocks, and soon you can escape back to the quiet small town feel by passing the library. This close contrast of environments gives the city a magical appeal, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories tied to different parts of town. Whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. Yet, like all places, it holds some harsh memories. The ponds are particularly suited for reflection or late-night cries during existential crises, an experience I know well. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives with purpose makes me question my own as I navigate life’s mysteries. I walked past the pond, through the park, and past suburban homes until I reached a main street. Then, as sunlight streamed over the palm trees and painted the sky, I realized I was heading north. As expected, the mountains were there, towering over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this place—it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect people to live, or at least not where most would choose to. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels occupied mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. Along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls meticulously arranged along the road. The first ones you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory activities, so we'll gloss over those—appearances can be misleading, after all. Yet, the apartments next to them and the two adjacent complexes offer a world almost unknown to the local residents. Across from these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their early mornings. The iron gates creak open for them, while commuters express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road meets another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm air. Children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at teenage girls chatting by the playground about boys and YouTube trends. A sushi restaurant in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable food but rarely sees a crowd. Next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one place—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold cups of yogurt topped with sweets, skateboarding and vaping in the park, thinking it's the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most residences are single-family homes, but some have been divided into two units while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like the majority of homes here, it evokes a time when suburban living was considered the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation but is now fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others persist, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were; the upkeep of small yards has declined. However, driveways still hold a car or two, and children play as if their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, inspiring the youth with a sense of future while evoking nostalgia among older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, yet basketball courts remain bustling. Although the homes all look different, they have a similar feel. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the area. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have been here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but with the decline of karate-themed movies, it has been replaced by a pharmacy, suggesting that medication solves problems, or so they say. There's also a small movie theater that screens classic films at reduced prices, unpopular with the youth due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable night out, sans children. An expressway runs through town, though its exit and entrance are located in the neighboring town. A petition once proposed an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by elders who felt it would harm the community. The elders eventually convinced the city council to reject it. A new high school is under construction, and we're deciding on a mascot. I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent our town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a wide range of businesses operate. These include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is an abundance of new dining options and places to shop. Some shops are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are gaining popularity, too. They can be found in malls and along streets, close to neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the many attractions nearby. There are also a few parks close by, where I've noticed many people take their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's significant diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, there is a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even short distances can mean long drives; traveling 10 miles can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city. Although some attractions are nearby, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging. Despite this, there's been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone lives, or wants to live, in large apartment complexes. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties host single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This diversity in housing is present even in my immediate neighborhood. The community consists of people of all ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community anymore, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the vast, open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home, and she had never encountered so much open space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I shared my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she began to understand who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry, beyond which lies the small community I call home. The houses, primarily made of brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In the spring, flowers are planted in abundance, and the trees reflect the changing seasons characteristic of the Midwest. The driveways are filled with top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz luxury cars, gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue towards my grey stucco house, you’ll likely see my Korean neighbor outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, singing along over the sound of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he remains sincere and has a fascinating history. Although he has grown older and lost some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam around, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, there was always an adventure waiting and usually a neighborhood child to share it with. Winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they hold a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant flowers become bare, skeletal structures. Occasionally, when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would construct large igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, often using branches. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where the landscape transitions from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Any destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most picturesque areas in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful and easily accessible for a quick visit. My neighborhood embodies the small-town spirit. The houses are not densely packed nor are they identical; instead, they are older homes, some renovated and others retaining their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses feature older aluminum siding, and you can find homes in every color imaginable around mine. Most residences have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some people maintain gardens, while others have fenced areas for their pets. The houses reflect the character of Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, and people are often out walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize and greet each other, identifying those who belong and those who do not. It's common to see someone grilling outside or to exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left from autumn. The green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are trimmed. Although not a neighborhood that impresses with upscale homes, it conveys a sense of being a great place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While its appearance is average, it stands out for embodying what people desire most: a secure place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department adjacent. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving both neighbors and city residents. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is nearby, and the sound of small planes taking off and landing is familiar whether you're inside or out. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, downtown is within reach from our residential area. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice nothing but well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards all look quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see small trees as well. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved concrete. Although many different families live here, the roads are in excellent condition, free from potholes and the like. Most houses are single-story, though you'll occasionally see two-story ones as well. We don't have the usual mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, similar to apartments. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, the HOA and their focus on uniformity are to thank for this. My house is located at the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood is partly rural and partly suburban. This provides us with plenty of land for various purposes. There are several community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough for running around to get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. Alongside them, there's a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect and rely on. For example, we have one mall, which isn't huge but serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, I find a wide variety of stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with a limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have many nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn't right next door, a short drive will take you to any major chain you desire.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast discussing missing persons. It was somewhat surprising, as nearly every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars monthly. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Perhaps it's about the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You begin to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes with mothball odors. You notice smells less as an adult. You may start smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. But the flea market is always distinct. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It settles into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores nearby. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. Regardless of how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon, and more of those afternoons come each year as the city grows. Cars and people flood the area. It's a developing city, known for hosting one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it still faces growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you like, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's an energetic place to be. With the pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, our apartment is less about strangers and more about a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help when needed. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. I deliver their mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, but it's neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban fringe of a major city. My neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by people with low incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are usually friendly and often greet me with a smile when I pass by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks in the last decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Last year, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Luckily, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item vanishing from our porch if left outside. Overall, my town has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many parts of the U.S., with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources in the town to address this crisis, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these issues, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying due to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to an inability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most improvements have been focused on the town center and the west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options, both small businesses and large retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be very valuable, but it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and set on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down from my place, there's a trendy arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up the hill is the closest city park, which is quite large given its location. The park is encircled by concrete with tall stairs built into the walls. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy winter rains make it challenging to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than on the outskirts, they can keep warmer. They're also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can wash and shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I cherish about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even thirty years later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher neighborhoods, the locals strive to maintain its cleanliness and care deeply about their city and block. There's an old warning that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning harks back to the past and is tinged with social conditioning. Maybe I blend in enough to not be seen as completely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the societal issues that linger nationwide. These reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance persist, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel invigorated walking its streets at night, encountering people more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open longer so I could charge my phone when I had no shelter from the rain. It's where I've sat, thinking myself invisible, only for someone to notice, hand me $5, and remind me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but eventually, I became close with someone who lived two houses away and another friend from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I can hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the neighbors, and you're generally left in peace unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose during football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy swings and slides. The park now brings a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of food options within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food is popular, as in most suburbs, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, such as an Indian-owned store for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I really enjoy my neighborhood. Reading about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently changed its name and has become pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly college students and lower-income individuals, as the apartments are relatively cheap. There's an elementary school nearby, so there are many children around. Although I don't interact with my neighbors, I'm not inclined to either. They smoke a lot of marijuana, prompting management to place an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly insulting. The buildings nearby typically appear old but may have updated interiors. A short distance away, new apartments have been constructed, but I don't favor them due to their poor construction and high rent, which I view as a rip-off justified by their proximity to campus. Close by is a very affordable restaurant that serves food on paper plates and mostly reheats it in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station that reportedly isn’t a great place to work. Recently, the city improved the road, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but it's still more wooded than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street behind it is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and run-down buildings. The abundance of trees there likely serves to conceal the buildings' condition. Most crime in the area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but there are also issues with crime and a transient population in the apartments across from me. Despite this, I like my neighborhood. It's affordable and conveniently located, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby, making trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They are scattered and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow, has white porches, and features green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of an unassigned driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This experience is a refreshing break from the modern world's focus on technology and computers. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies and fluffy clouds. The only drawback this season is the tornado warnings. Last night, for the first time, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my bigger dog refused to come into the bathroom, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road steamed due to the temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees within minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the warm pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I hurried inside to grab my camera and captured the scene to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooking. This neighborhood is very welcoming for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else here. Although all the houses look identical on the outside, the apartments differ inside, with some being surprisingly small. It puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which is not meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a large bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like residing in a small village community. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. I was fortunate to discover this delightful neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for around 10 years, I think I can share my experiences. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I was quite sad. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was tough, and I cried because I missed my old friends and loved ones. However, my parents wanted a better environment for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and a nicer high school, far from what we considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends and some enemies at school. I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value them. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyous occasion. I caught the garter, but missed the bouquet! We danced all night, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, although I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I explore it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis to play video games and make the most of life. I find peace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and occasionally bring my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, despite the hard work. I've had many enjoyable moments here, and while these are some highlights, I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not be distinctive among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as highlighted on its welcome sign. The area is mainly made up of farmland with peach trees or cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart; most are two-story with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or have gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing for front fields used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are found. For \"fast food,\" you can choose between Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There was once a pizzeria, but it closed recently. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's small, pricey grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Despite being the sole grocery store, many residents only buy a few items there, preferring to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known community member, which has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Attached to this store is a pet grooming facility, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's office and veterinary practice are located outside the town center; both are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there are no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might pass through without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's a generally quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. Neighbors mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located on the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars people drive around here. We tend to notice unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes as you might expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and me. So, I imagine others are used to seeing us come and go, too. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, which fills the air with a pleasant aroma. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March until around October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees because it was originally a wooded area, providing plenty of shade, but also an abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a nice indicator that fall has arrived. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, it's quite peaceful here. Thanksgiving brings some visiting families, and extra cars are parked everywhere, similar to other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a lawn, you know the owner is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely scattered. It's still largely the same, but there have been many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to resemble a city more and more each day, though I suppose that's a common trend everywhere. While most people here are quite friendly, just like any city, there are good areas and bad ones. I live in a neighborhood surrounded by welcoming elderly folks, so it's probably one of the nicer areas. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale options, you have to travel a bit; there aren't any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, though this is just my observation and not based on official statistics. This might be because the city is still underdeveloped, with lots of open land left to build on, which worries me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and have no desire to return. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field—I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here is the variety of wildlife. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert's climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these non-human neighbors to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, all of whom are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun, the Victorville way. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that tell the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I have a somewhat distinct perspective. Unlike many who might describe their neighborhoods as homeowners with separate lives, my experience is a bit different. I see the college campus where I reside as my neighborhood, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also view the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area before delving into them. There are three main housing options nearby: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with each floor containing about 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 residents each. The standalone houses are available for rent by those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom configurations. These houses are few and scattered, as they are less space-efficient. Lastly, the dormitories, which are the most prevalent, house hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room, with some exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the residents. My school prides itself on diversity, reflected in the cultural and age variety of those living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff reside in the on-campus houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so let’s discuss the shops and parks. My school functions as a self-sufficient neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's own branded clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, anything needed is accessible within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse residents and is kept clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. My house is perched atop the steepest hill around, which slopes downward. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" because it's popular with joggers as part of their exercise routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians use the road, which has a few potholes that make driving a bit risky. Some telephone and power lines in the area look ragged due to frequent storms that knock down branches and debris, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere, but residents often cut them down to enhance the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay's scenery. The view is stunning at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, though it's mostly cloudy, making the sunlight appear through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, with moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. There aren't many children here, despite a nearby school; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often seen in yards or running down the street, sometimes sneaking into open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to guide it outside. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in our neighborhood. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, along with the occasional hawk or eagle, until they are chased off by crows. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is a popular way to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. As you explore, be ready to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll come across an Asian-owned store nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly common. These businesses are favored by locals because they offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are very convenient. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping very convenient. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for summer fun. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds enjoying them. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family houses. People here are generally nice but can be quite noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which might wake you up. If you visit at night, stay alert. While the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, and package theft is a recent issue. Although New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, many people here disregard this rule. Every morning, you'll likely spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is seeing dog waste everywhere, so watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The city's unofficial motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes skirting the law—says \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this serves as a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a city less famous and costly, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weirdness here doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what is usually not accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of the nation, most of what we purchase comes from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. The city has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take everything a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, we have vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes during summer. Free boxes, typically cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items someone no longer wants, often containing a perfect treasure for a passerby. They usually have clothes and books, but can include anything. The enchanting experience of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me—though I'm just one among many types of weird here. Some locals wouldn't dream of choosing clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might attend goat yoga (yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is filled with people who love diverse things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream of doing so while spending excessive time at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which often stems from mental health issues exacerbated by the frequent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, but these are inadequate, much like elsewhere in the country. Residents' attitudes towards the homeless fluctuate between compassion and disdain, making us not so weird in this aspect.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun’s path at every dawn and dusk. Even when I overlook them, distracted by work and life, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand attention, and when I finally notice them, they offer solace to my anxious mind, giving me the strength to continue, one day at a time. I moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were the first to capture my attention. The university is also filled with stunning sights—buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured my heart—but the mountains reign supreme. The rest of the town has its own beauty. There are numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride downtown reveals an old-world charm with faded colored bricks adorning the restaurants and office buildings, where the town matches the hustle of its neighboring city. This lively atmosphere only spans a few blocks, and soon you can escape back to the quiet small town feel by passing the library. This close contrast of environments gives the city a magical appeal, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories tied to different parts of town. Whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. Yet, like all places, it holds some harsh memories. The ponds are particularly suited for reflection or late-night cries during existential crises, an experience I know well. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives with purpose makes me question my own as I navigate life’s mysteries. I walked past the pond, through the park, and past suburban homes until I reached a main street. Then, as sunlight streamed over the palm trees and painted the sky, I realized I was heading north. As expected, the mountains were there, towering over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this place—it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect people to live, or at least not where most would choose to. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels occupied mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. Along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls meticulously arranged along the road. The first ones you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory activities, so we'll gloss over those—appearances can be misleading, after all. Yet, the apartments next to them and the two adjacent complexes offer a world almost unknown to the local residents. Across from these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their early mornings. The iron gates creak open for them, while commuters express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road meets another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm air. Children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at teenage girls chatting by the playground about boys and YouTube trends. A sushi restaurant in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable food but rarely sees a crowd. Next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one place—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold cups of yogurt topped with sweets, skateboarding and vaping in the park, thinking it's the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most residences are single-family homes, but some have been divided into two units while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like the majority of homes here, it evokes a time when suburban living was considered the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation but is now fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others persist, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were; the upkeep of small yards has declined. However, driveways still hold a car or two, and children play as if their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, inspiring the youth with a sense of future while evoking nostalgia among older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, yet basketball courts remain bustling. Although the homes all look different, they have a similar feel. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the area. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have been here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but with the decline of karate-themed movies, it has been replaced by a pharmacy, suggesting that medication solves problems, or so they say. There's also a small movie theater that screens classic films at reduced prices, unpopular with the youth due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable night out, sans children. An expressway runs through town, though its exit and entrance are located in the neighboring town. A petition once proposed an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by elders who felt it would harm the community. The elders eventually convinced the city council to reject it. A new high school is under construction, and we're deciding on a mascot. I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent our town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a wide range of businesses operate. These include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is an abundance of new dining options and places to shop. Some shops are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are gaining popularity, too. They can be found in malls and along streets, close to neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the many attractions nearby. There are also a few parks close by, where I've noticed many people take their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's significant diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, there is a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even short distances can mean long drives; traveling 10 miles can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city. Although some attractions are nearby, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging. Despite this, there's been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone lives, or wants to live, in large apartment complexes. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties host single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This diversity in housing is present even in my immediate neighborhood. The community consists of people of all ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community anymore, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the vast, open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home, and she had never encountered so much open space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I shared my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she began to understand who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry, beyond which lies the small community I call home. The houses, primarily made of brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In the spring, flowers are planted in abundance, and the trees reflect the changing seasons characteristic of the Midwest. The driveways are filled with top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz luxury cars, gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue towards my grey stucco house, you’ll likely see my Korean neighbor outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, singing along over the sound of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he remains sincere and has a fascinating history. Although he has grown older and lost some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam around, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, there was always an adventure waiting and usually a neighborhood child to share it with. Winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they hold a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant flowers become bare, skeletal structures. Occasionally, when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would construct large igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, often using branches. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where the landscape transitions from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Any destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most picturesque areas in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful and easily accessible for a quick visit. My neighborhood embodies the small-town spirit. The houses are not densely packed nor are they identical; instead, they are older homes, some renovated and others retaining their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses feature older aluminum siding, and you can find homes in every color imaginable around mine. Most residences have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some people maintain gardens, while others have fenced areas for their pets. The houses reflect the character of Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, and people are often out walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize and greet each other, identifying those who belong and those who do not. It's common to see someone grilling outside or to exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left from autumn. The green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are trimmed. Although not a neighborhood that impresses with upscale homes, it conveys a sense of being a great place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While its appearance is average, it stands out for embodying what people desire most: a secure place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department adjacent. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving both neighbors and city residents. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is nearby, and the sound of small planes taking off and landing is familiar whether you're inside or out. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, downtown is within reach from our residential area. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice nothing but well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards all look quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see small trees as well. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved concrete. Although many different families live here, the roads are in excellent condition, free from potholes and the like. Most houses are single-story, though you'll occasionally see two-story ones as well. We don't have the usual mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, similar to apartments. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, the HOA and their focus on uniformity are to thank for this. My house is located at the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood is partly rural and partly suburban. This provides us with plenty of land for various purposes. There are several community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough for running around to get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. Alongside them, there's a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect and rely on. For example, we have one mall, which isn't huge but serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, I find a wide variety of stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with a limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have many nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn't right next door, a short drive will take you to any major chain you desire.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast discussing missing persons. It was somewhat surprising, as nearly every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars monthly. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Perhaps it's about the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You begin to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes with mothball odors. You notice smells less as an adult. You may start smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. But the flea market is always distinct. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It settles into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores nearby. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. Regardless of how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon, and more of those afternoons come each year as the city grows. Cars and people flood the area. It's a developing city, known for hosting one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it still faces growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you like, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's an energetic place to be. With the pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, our apartment is less about strangers and more about a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help when needed. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. I deliver their mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, but it's neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban fringe of a major city. My neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by people with low incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are usually friendly and often greet me with a smile when I pass by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks in the last decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Last year, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Luckily, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item vanishing from our porch if left outside. Overall, my town has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many parts of the U.S., with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources in the town to address this crisis, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these issues, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying due to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to an inability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most improvements have been focused on the town center and the west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options, both small businesses and large retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be very valuable, but it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and set on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down from my place, there's a trendy arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up the hill is the closest city park, which is quite large given its location. The park is encircled by concrete with tall stairs built into the walls. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy winter rains make it challenging to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than on the outskirts, they can keep warmer. They're also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can wash and shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I cherish about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even thirty years later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher neighborhoods, the locals strive to maintain its cleanliness and care deeply about their city and block. There's an old warning that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning harks back to the past and is tinged with social conditioning. Maybe I blend in enough to not be seen as completely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the societal issues that linger nationwide. These reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance persist, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel invigorated walking its streets at night, encountering people more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open longer so I could charge my phone when I had no shelter from the rain. It's where I've sat, thinking myself invisible, only for someone to notice, hand me $5, and remind me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but eventually, I became close with someone who lived two houses away and another friend from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I can hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the neighbors, and you're generally left in peace unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose during football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy swings and slides. The park now brings a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of food options within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food is popular, as in most suburbs, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, such as an Indian-owned store for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I really enjoy my neighborhood. Reading about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently changed its name and has become pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly college students and lower-income individuals, as the apartments are relatively cheap. There's an elementary school nearby, so there are many children around. Although I don't interact with my neighbors, I'm not inclined to either. They smoke a lot of marijuana, prompting management to place an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly insulting. The buildings nearby typically appear old but may have updated interiors. A short distance away, new apartments have been constructed, but I don't favor them due to their poor construction and high rent, which I view as a rip-off justified by their proximity to campus. Close by is a very affordable restaurant that serves food on paper plates and mostly reheats it in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station that reportedly isn’t a great place to work. Recently, the city improved the road, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but it's still more wooded than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street behind it is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and run-down buildings. The abundance of trees there likely serves to conceal the buildings' condition. Most crime in the area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but there are also issues with crime and a transient population in the apartments across from me. Despite this, I like my neighborhood. It's affordable and conveniently located, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby, making trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They are scattered and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow, has white porches, and features green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of an unassigned driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This experience is a refreshing break from the modern world's focus on technology and computers. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies and fluffy clouds. The only drawback this season is the tornado warnings. Last night, for the first time, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my bigger dog refused to come into the bathroom, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road steamed due to the temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees within minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the warm pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I hurried inside to grab my camera and captured the scene to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooking. This neighborhood is very welcoming for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else here. Although all the houses look identical on the outside, the apartments differ inside, with some being surprisingly small. It puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which is not meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a large bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like residing in a small village community. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. I was fortunate to discover this delightful neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for around 10 years, I think I can share my experiences. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I was quite sad. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was tough, and I cried because I missed my old friends and loved ones. However, my parents wanted a better environment for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and a nicer high school, far from what we considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends and some enemies at school. I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value them. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyous occasion. I caught the garter, but missed the bouquet! We danced all night, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, although I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I explore it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis to play video games and make the most of life. I find peace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and occasionally bring my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, despite the hard work. I've had many enjoyable moments here, and while these are some highlights, I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not be distinctive among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as highlighted on its welcome sign. The area is mainly made up of farmland with peach trees or cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart; most are two-story with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or have gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing for front fields used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are found. For \"fast food,\" you can choose between Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There was once a pizzeria, but it closed recently. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's small, pricey grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Despite being the sole grocery store, many residents only buy a few items there, preferring to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known community member, which has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Attached to this store is a pet grooming facility, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's office and veterinary practice are located outside the town center; both are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there are no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might pass through without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's a generally quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. Neighbors mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located on the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars people drive around here. We tend to notice unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes as you might expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and me. So, I imagine others are used to seeing us come and go, too. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, which fills the air with a pleasant aroma. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March until around October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees because it was originally a wooded area, providing plenty of shade, but also an abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a nice indicator that fall has arrived. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, it's quite peaceful here. Thanksgiving brings some visiting families, and extra cars are parked everywhere, similar to other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a lawn, you know the owner is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely scattered. It's still largely the same, but there have been many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to resemble a city more and more each day, though I suppose that's a common trend everywhere. While most people here are quite friendly, just like any city, there are good areas and bad ones. I live in a neighborhood surrounded by welcoming elderly folks, so it's probably one of the nicer areas. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale options, you have to travel a bit; there aren't any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, though this is just my observation and not based on official statistics. This might be because the city is still underdeveloped, with lots of open land left to build on, which worries me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and have no desire to return. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field—I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here is the variety of wildlife. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert's climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these non-human neighbors to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, all of whom are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun, the Victorville way. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that tell the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I have a somewhat distinct perspective. Unlike many who might describe their neighborhoods as homeowners with separate lives, my experience is a bit different. I see the college campus where I reside as my neighborhood, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also view the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area before delving into them. There are three main housing options nearby: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with each floor containing about 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 residents each. The standalone houses are available for rent by those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom configurations. These houses are few and scattered, as they are less space-efficient. Lastly, the dormitories, which are the most prevalent, house hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room, with some exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the residents. My school prides itself on diversity, reflected in the cultural and age variety of those living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff reside in the on-campus houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so let’s discuss the shops and parks. My school functions as a self-sufficient neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's own branded clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, anything needed is accessible within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse residents and is kept clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. My house is perched atop the steepest hill around, which slopes downward. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" because it's popular with joggers as part of their exercise routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians use the road, which has a few potholes that make driving a bit risky. Some telephone and power lines in the area look ragged due to frequent storms that knock down branches and debris, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere, but residents often cut them down to enhance the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay's scenery. The view is stunning at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, though it's mostly cloudy, making the sunlight appear through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, with moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. There aren't many children here, despite a nearby school; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often seen in yards or running down the street, sometimes sneaking into open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to guide it outside. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in our neighborhood. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, along with the occasional hawk or eagle, until they are chased off by crows. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is a popular way to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. As you explore, be ready to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll come across an Asian-owned store nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly common. These businesses are favored by locals because they offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are very convenient. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping very convenient. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for summer fun. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds enjoying them. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family houses. People here are generally nice but can be quite noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which might wake you up. If you visit at night, stay alert. While the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, and package theft is a recent issue. Although New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, many people here disregard this rule. Every morning, you'll likely spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is seeing dog waste everywhere, so watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The city's unofficial motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes skirting the law—says \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this serves as a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a city less famous and costly, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weirdness here doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what is usually not accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of the nation, most of what we purchase comes from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. The city has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take everything a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, we have vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes during summer. Free boxes, typically cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items someone no longer wants, often containing a perfect treasure for a passerby. They usually have clothes and books, but can include anything. The enchanting experience of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me—though I'm just one among many types of weird here. Some locals wouldn't dream of choosing clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might attend goat yoga (yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is filled with people who love diverse things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream of doing so while spending excessive time at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which often stems from mental health issues exacerbated by the frequent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, but these are inadequate, much like elsewhere in the country. Residents' attitudes towards the homeless fluctuate between compassion and disdain, making us not so weird in this aspect.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun’s path at every dawn and dusk. Even when I overlook them, distracted by work and life, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand attention, and when I finally notice them, they offer solace to my anxious mind, giving me the strength to continue, one day at a time. I moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were the first to capture my attention. The university is also filled with stunning sights—buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured my heart—but the mountains reign supreme. The rest of the town has its own beauty. There are numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride downtown reveals an old-world charm with faded colored bricks adorning the restaurants and office buildings, where the town matches the hustle of its neighboring city. This lively atmosphere only spans a few blocks, and soon you can escape back to the quiet small town feel by passing the library. This close contrast of environments gives the city a magical appeal, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories tied to different parts of town. Whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. Yet, like all places, it holds some harsh memories. The ponds are particularly suited for reflection or late-night cries during existential crises, an experience I know well. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives with purpose makes me question my own as I navigate life’s mysteries. I walked past the pond, through the park, and past suburban homes until I reached a main street. Then, as sunlight streamed over the palm trees and painted the sky, I realized I was heading north. As expected, the mountains were there, towering over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this place—it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect people to live, or at least not where most would choose to. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels occupied mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. Along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls meticulously arranged along the road. The first ones you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory activities, so we'll gloss over those—appearances can be misleading, after all. Yet, the apartments next to them and the two adjacent complexes offer a world almost unknown to the local residents. Across from these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their early mornings. The iron gates creak open for them, while commuters express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road meets another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm air. Children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at teenage girls chatting by the playground about boys and YouTube trends. A sushi restaurant in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable food but rarely sees a crowd. Next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one place—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold cups of yogurt topped with sweets, skateboarding and vaping in the park, thinking it's the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most residences are single-family homes, but some have been divided into two units while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like the majority of homes here, it evokes a time when suburban living was considered the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation but is now fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others persist, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were; the upkeep of small yards has declined. However, driveways still hold a car or two, and children play as if their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, inspiring the youth with a sense of future while evoking nostalgia among older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, yet basketball courts remain bustling. Although the homes all look different, they have a similar feel. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the area. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have been here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but with the decline of karate-themed movies, it has been replaced by a pharmacy, suggesting that medication solves problems, or so they say. There's also a small movie theater that screens classic films at reduced prices, unpopular with the youth due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable night out, sans children. An expressway runs through town, though its exit and entrance are located in the neighboring town. A petition once proposed an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by elders who felt it would harm the community. The elders eventually convinced the city council to reject it. A new high school is under construction, and we're deciding on a mascot. I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent our town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a wide range of businesses operate. These include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is an abundance of new dining options and places to shop. Some shops are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are gaining popularity, too. They can be found in malls and along streets, close to neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the many attractions nearby. There are also a few parks close by, where I've noticed many people take their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's significant diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, there is a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even short distances can mean long drives; traveling 10 miles can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city. Although some attractions are nearby, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging. Despite this, there's been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone lives, or wants to live, in large apartment complexes. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties host single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This diversity in housing is present even in my immediate neighborhood. The community consists of people of all ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community anymore, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the vast, open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home, and she had never encountered so much open space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I shared my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she began to understand who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry, beyond which lies the small community I call home. The houses, primarily made of brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In the spring, flowers are planted in abundance, and the trees reflect the changing seasons characteristic of the Midwest. The driveways are filled with top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz luxury cars, gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue towards my grey stucco house, you’ll likely see my Korean neighbor outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, singing along over the sound of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he remains sincere and has a fascinating history. Although he has grown older and lost some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam around, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, there was always an adventure waiting and usually a neighborhood child to share it with. Winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they hold a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant flowers become bare, skeletal structures. Occasionally, when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would construct large igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, often using branches. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most stunning locations in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is encircled by water, with beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. No matter where you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood exemplifies the essence of a small town. Houses are not crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, with some being updated and remodeled while others retain their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the area have older aluminum siding. The blocks around my house feature homes in every color you can imagine. Most houses have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America, where hardworking people strive to make a living and are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, you will see children running along the streets, as well as people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. You might see someone grilling outside and wave, or encounter someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and exchange a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left over from fall. The grass is green, mowed, and tidy. If there are plants and bushes in the yards, they are neatly trimmed. It isn't a neighborhood that impresses with stunning homes, but rather one that gives the impression of being a great place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it may look average, it is exceptional because it embodies what people desire—a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is right next to them. The city recycling center is a short distance away, providing services to locals and city residents. We have nearby baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and player names. Our small-town airport is adjacent to these fields. You can be indoors or out and hear the rumble of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is about 8 blocks away. It really is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburb with a uniform appearance. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll only see well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the association's efforts. The front yards look quite similar, featuring small patches of manicured grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads. Despite various families living here, the streets are kept in excellent shape, free from potholes. While most houses are single-story, there are some two-story ones as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each home, there is a communal mailbox setup similar to apartments, with a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, each accessible by key, and a couple of larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is again thanks to the HOA. My house is situated on the city's outskirts, making the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, there's ample space for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple well-maintained and gated community pools. There are also several walking trails, perfect for walking your dog or enjoying a solitary evening stroll, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is large enough for a good run. The community mostly consists of retirees, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals as well. The nearby city is quite large population-wise but retains a small-town vibe. It offers most standard amenities, including a single mall that, while not massive, is adequate. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of shops to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited stock and minimal staffing to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and fairly typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. While we're not immediately next to shopping areas, a short drive will take you to any major retailer you desire.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was from a podcast discussing missing people. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither I nor my friends had heard about that story before. Maybe it’s the challenge. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high costs, but over time, we’ve become skilled at being thrifty. You grow fond of the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that smell of mothballs. As adults, we tend to notice smells less. You might pick up smoking, or simply become used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market's presence is always felt. The scent of adulthood resembles old magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself into leather and lingers even after washing. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio store. Downtown is bustling, crowded with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the shops remain silent. It’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city grows busier, filled with cars and people. They call it a developing city, home to one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still adjusting to growth. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own objectives, and not much is expected of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and self-reliant, and people will respect your space. It’s unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, you don’t intrude into others’ lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It’s an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In some ways, we’re less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and look out for each other. It’s nice to see them, and I think they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern city, it’s neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven’t completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, located just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the east side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area here. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amicable, often greeting me with smiles and hellos as I walk by. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has only been indirectly affected by crime, with occasional items disappearing from our porch if left out. Overall, our town has been deeply impacted by the opioid crisis that has afflicted many areas in the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are many resources available here to address this issue, including several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town offers many positives. My son’s elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not experienced any bullying due to the school’s incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. The PTO is active, organizing numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational growth. With over 20% of the town’s population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town’s appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these efforts have been concentrated in the town center and west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are located, leaving the east side where I live somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. Despite these issues, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are plenty of shopping options, ranging from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family’s needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Nestled on a hill, it's surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill is a charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends, especially in June and July, you often see lines of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious given its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. While it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, keeps them warmer. They are also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing and showering facilities. What I love about my city is not just the charm of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered throughout the hills rolling toward the ocean. What I truly cherish about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous as the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast due to gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these events, and tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders that plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood is typical of an American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is generally quiet during the week. I've never had issues with anyone here; people leave you alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online without any being stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from the park when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the positive memories outweigh that. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now brings me a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of nearby food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine within a mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned shop for those wanting to cook or buy Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading horror stories about neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to my college. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, along with some fun and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit more expensive, but the quality of drinks and service is decent. The people here are generally nice; many are college students or from lower-income backgrounds, as the apartments are quite affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors well, nor do I wish to, as they smoke a lot of weed. The management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and almost offensive. The buildings in the area mostly look old but might have updated interiors. There are new apartments down the street, but I dislike them because they're poorly constructed yet expensive to rent, which seems like a rip-off considering their proximity to campus. There's a very cheap restaurant about five minutes away that uses paper plates and mostly serves microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. Fortunately, the city funded improvements last summer, so the roads have new sidewalks and grassy medians, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind us is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. Although there are many trees, they seem to hide the buildings' poor appearance. Most crimes occur at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I can't solely blame them since the apartments across from me also experience crime and have a transient population. Overall, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities nearby. I appreciate being within walking distance of the university and having two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes are scattered along a cul-de-sac, designed to resemble individual houses. They all share a uniform look, painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, and on some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway for casual chats while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This setting offers a refreshing contrast to the modern, tech-driven world, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The area is surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog stayed nervously in the living room, barking at the unusual situation. The only sounds outside were of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, melting the hail upon impact. As the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared, prompting me to dash inside for my camera to capture the moment and share it on Facebook, where it amazed my friends and family. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm, and life resumed with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. This welcoming neighborhood is a joy for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I love the local southern accent. Everyone here has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors differ, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and down to the non-swimmable pond. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, the giant bullfrog can be heard singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms, adding to the village-like feel of the community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share my experiences. When I first arrived in my neighborhood, I was quite sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t deny it—I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and schools, a location that was considered “not ghetto.” Over time, I adapted, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, since they lived next door. They’ve been wonderful people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got remarried) with my family. It was incredibly fun, and I look forward to having a similar experience someday, as I work to build a prosperous life for my future wife. At the wedding, when Ms. Veda tossed the garter, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s doing well in life. My neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. My exploration has mostly been with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of life. I sometimes visit the park to enjoy nature, which brings me peace and calm. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword when I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are basketball and tennis courts too, though I haven’t played in a while. It’s nice to have the option if I want to try again. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I’ve had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and while there are many stories to tell, these are the highlights. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town that doesn't particularly stand out from others in South Carolina, yet it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry. Johnston proudly declares itself as the Peach Capital of the World, a claim featured on its welcome sign. The area is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two-story buildings with either metal roofs to combat the hot summer sun or gray shingles. Typically, these houses are set back from the road, with the front fields used for livestock or crops. In the town center, a single traffic light hangs over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town's only stores. \"Fast food\" options here include Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but has recently closed. There's a tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known humorously for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, leading many locals to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. Dollar General is the town's most popular store, bustling from open to close with its wide selection of daily necessities. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known local woman, has been a Johnston fixture for years and offers delivery service. Attached to this store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The only school is Johnston Elementary School, with middle and high school students attending classes in the neighboring town. While the town lacks parks, it is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more activities and attract visitors or new residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants, the town is endearing and small enough to pass through before you even notice!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I’ve become familiar with most of the residents. People typically occupy themselves with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that frequent the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we tend to notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids often ride their bikes, as you’d expect. We work from home, so we’re around a lot. Our family includes my wife, our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and myself. I assume the neighbors are accustomed to our comings and goings as well. We like to play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of grilling. From March to October, someone is always mowing their lawn, so the sound of a lawnmower is nearly constant. Originally a wooded area, our neighborhood has many trees offering ample shade, but they also bring plenty of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged autumn. Our garage is situated at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless there's a knock, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. The area is quite serene during holidays. Thanksgiving brings some families visiting from out of town, resulting in extra parked cars. The same occurs during holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt. Unless someone has lived here, they might not fully grasp what it's like to constantly see brown landscapes. A lawn is a rare sight, and when you do spot one, it’s clear that the owner is spending a lot on its maintenance. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely distributed. Although there are many new developments now, the spread-out nature remains. Honestly, this place increasingly resembles a city every day, but I suppose that's a common trend. Generally, people here are very friendly, though, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by amicable elderly people, making it a nicer area. The stores mostly consist of chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel; I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores nearby. Construction seems to be the most prevalent job in my city, though this is just my observation. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning as I prefer the current state. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. My job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty, among other reasons. The climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection, supporting various wildlife. Residents should learn about these non-human inhabitants to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write, they’re outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a fun and engaging time. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports activities to enjoy. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert can visit the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unique. While most people answering this question are likely homeowners with their own separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the residents of my dormitory are my community. I also include the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this difference, my neighborhood has similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. In my immediate area, there are three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around 2 floors, meaning roughly 20 people live in each building. Second, there are actual houses available for rent by those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, often rented by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are standard dorm rooms housing hundreds of students. Typically, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common housing type in my neighborhood. With housing described, we can move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while new students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students stay in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people here with mere words, so I'll move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has numerous stores and one park. The stores include a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's borders! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, maintained clean and safe by the community members themselves!",
            "There are few sidewalks in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my home is perched at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. It's known as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers include it in their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has some potholes and can feel a bit unsafe to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often damage the power lines, leading to constant repairs that make them look patchwork-like. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but residents don't like them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so sunlight is often seen through a mist. Most days are overcast and damp, causing moss to grow on everything, from roofs to cars and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in green moss that took three hours to remove. There aren't many children around, despite a school nearby. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs, which are often seen on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak inside. I once found one in my living room and had to escort it out. Rabbits roam freely here, and some are quite large, which gardeners dislike because they dig up plant roots and burrow in lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most out of the neighborhood. We also have typical birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, with an occasional hawk or eagle, though neighborhood crows usually chase them away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few seafood restaurants. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't find it hard to reach! Public transportation is easily available and is one of the most used ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban area, so you'll still experience the New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to see a variety of Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has experienced an increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll come across an Asian-owned store on nearly every block while walking. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are favored by locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food, the prices are significantly lower, and they provide convenience. Just near where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from one another, adding to the ease of getting groceries. However, I'm not suggesting Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is actually quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most of the major and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these, there's also a recently upgraded park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are very diverse, where everyone can play and interact well together. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The buildings you'll find are mainly co-op living spaces or condominium apartments. Most residences here are two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, although quite loud. Daily, you might hear cars with loud music passing by your house or revving their engines, which might wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay cautious. The neighborhood is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might encounter individuals looking to cause trouble, such as bullies and thieves. I have personally experienced bullying here in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which, although common, occur in this neighborhood. Finally, even though New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here often ignore this rule. Every morning, you might see at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is encountering dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you need to understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza restaurant, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less recognized and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite a wave of wealthy Californians moving in and the continuous rise of new condominiums to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always imply being accepting, but it does mean embracing things typically deemed unacceptable. It doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences or issues. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland also has its share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps being weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes usually contain items someone no longer wants, often placed in cardboard or plastic containers, offering a magical find, perfect for a passerby, more often than you'd expect. They often have clothes and books but can contain anything. The charm of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me, though I'm just one of many kinds of weird here. Some local residents wouldn't dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is teeming with people who have diverse interests. It's a place where people chase their dreams or dream of chasing them while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a challenge with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn here by the relatively better social services, though these services are still inadequate, as is the case nationwide. Residents' attitudes toward the homeless fluctuate between compassion and animosity, and in this regard, Portland isn't unique at all.",
            "The mountains remain constant, always present in the north, observing the sun's travels at dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them, preoccupied with work and life, they stand firm, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I gaze at them, they offer solace to my anxious heart, providing strength to carry on, one day at a time. When I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains near the campus were what initially captivated me. Although the university has its own stunning features, like its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way, with numerous cafés that served as venues for countless hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A brief walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an antique atmosphere that rivals the hustle and energy of the nearby city. This bustling vibe doesn't extend far, as one can quickly return to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments in close proximity gives the city a magical allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to form cherished memories linked to different parts of town, whether it's strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. However, like all places, it also holds harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as ideal spots for reflection or for tearful moments during existential crises at two in the morning, which I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects play their roles in life often led me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, the park, and the suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always, the towering mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—it's set in a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, a location not typically associated with housing. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are usually only filled during summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Within this neighborhood, the streets are lined with several apartment complexes, neatly arranged like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and aligned along the road. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory events, so we'll gloss over those—looks can be misleading. Next to them, though, are two other complexes that belong to a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where students, armed with coffee, arrive at 7 a.m., yawning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to welcome them, while commuters grumble and gesticulate at them for causing traffic delays on busy days. The road leads to another residential street, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from bone injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a gently spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children frolic in the park across the street, performing cartwheels and dashing across the grass, while bees meander among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the paths, frowning at teen skateboarders and smiling at the girls who are chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable meals but rarely seems crowded. Next to it, there's a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—a convenience provided by the strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold, dripping cups topped with treats as they skateboard and vape, believing it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a historical piece in the quiet South where things remain unchanged, even time itself.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most of the homes are single-family, although some have been divided into two connected units, if that makes sense. My house has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it reminds you of a time not too long ago when suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the people of this country, but now it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, still exists, still beckoning us and visitors to believe that the dream is alive, and we're holding onto it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the little yards aren't as well-maintained, but there are still a couple of cars in every driveway, and children play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. Each home looks different but feels the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, interest waned, and it turned into a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted rate, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but cherished by the older folks who appreciate a reasonably priced night out, sans kids. An expressway cuts through my town, though the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would disrupt the town, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is very diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, which host a variety of businesses. These businesses include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. Some shops are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, while small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and along streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods that are surrounded by numerous attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks frequented by people with young children. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite notable, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my neighborhood, there are many more individuals from various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away, but even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in the city because, despite some attractions being close, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. As a result, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and parking is challenging to find. Despite this, there has been significant construction recently, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. This trend makes it a popular destination, but many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increasing traffic. The city offers a variety of housing, as not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, which is true even in my immediate neighborhood, showcasing a diversity of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I remember playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were my age during my childhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk away—never before had she encountered so much open space. As she marveled at the expansive cornfields, I recounted my experiences growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally understood my roots. Traveling down a two-lane country road, we arrived at a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes, mainly made of brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of well-tended land. During spring, the area is vibrant with annually planted flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sparkling Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed and gleaming in the midday sun. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, was outside, usually spending the day mowing his lawn and singing over the sound of his mower. The neighborhood finds amusement in his antics, but he is genuinely kind and has an intriguing past. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam while our Terrier chases after them. Behind the house, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the flowing water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched paradise brimming with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly just chasing them), there was always an adventure, often shared with neighborhood friends. Winters in my town can be harsh yet stunning. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. Trees once adorned with vibrant blossoms become bare. When snow falls, it creates a magical wonderland overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We often bickered as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We constructed igloo-like forts for our snowball stash, usually using branches. In our private wonderland, we played and imagined, free from worries, simply being carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most stunning locations in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is encircled by water, with beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. No matter where you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood exemplifies the essence of a small town. Houses are not crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, with some being updated and remodeled while others retain their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the area have older aluminum siding. The blocks around my house feature homes in every color you can imagine. Most houses have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America, where hardworking people strive to make a living and are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, you will see children running along the streets, as well as people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. You might see someone grilling outside and wave, or encounter someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and exchange a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left over from fall. The grass is green, mowed, and tidy. If there are plants and bushes in the yards, they are neatly trimmed. It isn't a neighborhood that impresses with stunning homes, but rather one that gives the impression of being a great place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it may look average, it is exceptional because it embodies what people desire—a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is right next to them. The city recycling center is a short distance away, providing services to locals and city residents. We have nearby baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and player names. Our small-town airport is adjacent to these fields. You can be indoors or out and hear the rumble of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is about 8 blocks away. It really is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburb with a uniform appearance. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll only see well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the association's efforts. The front yards look quite similar, featuring small patches of manicured grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads. Despite various families living here, the streets are kept in excellent shape, free from potholes. While most houses are single-story, there are some two-story ones as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each home, there is a communal mailbox setup similar to apartments, with a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, each accessible by key, and a couple of larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is again thanks to the HOA. My house is situated on the city's outskirts, making the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, there's ample space for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple well-maintained and gated community pools. There are also several walking trails, perfect for walking your dog or enjoying a solitary evening stroll, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is large enough for a good run. The community mostly consists of retirees, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals as well. The nearby city is quite large population-wise but retains a small-town vibe. It offers most standard amenities, including a single mall that, while not massive, is adequate. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of shops to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited stock and minimal staffing to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and fairly typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. While we're not immediately next to shopping areas, a short drive will take you to any major retailer you desire.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was from a podcast discussing missing people. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither I nor my friends had heard about that story before. Maybe it’s the challenge. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high costs, but over time, we’ve become skilled at being thrifty. You grow fond of the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that smell of mothballs. As adults, we tend to notice smells less. You might pick up smoking, or simply become used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market's presence is always felt. The scent of adulthood resembles old magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself into leather and lingers even after washing. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio store. Downtown is bustling, crowded with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the shops remain silent. It’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city grows busier, filled with cars and people. They call it a developing city, home to one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still adjusting to growth. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own objectives, and not much is expected of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and self-reliant, and people will respect your space. It’s unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, you don’t intrude into others’ lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It’s an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In some ways, we’re less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and look out for each other. It’s nice to see them, and I think they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern city, it’s neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven’t completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, located just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the east side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area here. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amicable, often greeting me with smiles and hellos as I walk by. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has only been indirectly affected by crime, with occasional items disappearing from our porch if left out. Overall, our town has been deeply impacted by the opioid crisis that has afflicted many areas in the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are many resources available here to address this issue, including several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town offers many positives. My son’s elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not experienced any bullying due to the school’s incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. The PTO is active, organizing numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational growth. With over 20% of the town’s population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town’s appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these efforts have been concentrated in the town center and west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are located, leaving the east side where I live somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. Despite these issues, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are plenty of shopping options, ranging from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family’s needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Nestled on a hill, it's surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill is a charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends, especially in June and July, you often see lines of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious given its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. While it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, keeps them warmer. They are also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing and showering facilities. What I love about my city is not just the charm of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered throughout the hills rolling toward the ocean. What I truly cherish about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous as the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast due to gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these events, and tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders that plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood is typical of an American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is generally quiet during the week. I've never had issues with anyone here; people leave you alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online without any being stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from the park when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the positive memories outweigh that. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now brings me a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of nearby food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine within a mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned shop for those wanting to cook or buy Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading horror stories about neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to my college. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, along with some fun and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit more expensive, but the quality of drinks and service is decent. The people here are generally nice; many are college students or from lower-income backgrounds, as the apartments are quite affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors well, nor do I wish to, as they smoke a lot of weed. The management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and almost offensive. The buildings in the area mostly look old but might have updated interiors. There are new apartments down the street, but I dislike them because they're poorly constructed yet expensive to rent, which seems like a rip-off considering their proximity to campus. There's a very cheap restaurant about five minutes away that uses paper plates and mostly serves microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. Fortunately, the city funded improvements last summer, so the roads have new sidewalks and grassy medians, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind us is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. Although there are many trees, they seem to hide the buildings' poor appearance. Most crimes occur at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I can't solely blame them since the apartments across from me also experience crime and have a transient population. Overall, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities nearby. I appreciate being within walking distance of the university and having two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes are scattered along a cul-de-sac, designed to resemble individual houses. They all share a uniform look, painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, and on some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway for casual chats while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This setting offers a refreshing contrast to the modern, tech-driven world, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The area is surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog stayed nervously in the living room, barking at the unusual situation. The only sounds outside were of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, melting the hail upon impact. As the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared, prompting me to dash inside for my camera to capture the moment and share it on Facebook, where it amazed my friends and family. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm, and life resumed with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. This welcoming neighborhood is a joy for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I love the local southern accent. Everyone here has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors differ, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and down to the non-swimmable pond. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, the giant bullfrog can be heard singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms, adding to the village-like feel of the community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share my experiences. When I first arrived in my neighborhood, I was quite sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t deny it—I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and schools, a location that was considered “not ghetto.” Over time, I adapted, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, since they lived next door. They’ve been wonderful people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got remarried) with my family. It was incredibly fun, and I look forward to having a similar experience someday, as I work to build a prosperous life for my future wife. At the wedding, when Ms. Veda tossed the garter, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s doing well in life. My neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. My exploration has mostly been with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of life. I sometimes visit the park to enjoy nature, which brings me peace and calm. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword when I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are basketball and tennis courts too, though I haven’t played in a while. It’s nice to have the option if I want to try again. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I’ve had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and while there are many stories to tell, these are the highlights. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town that doesn't particularly stand out from others in South Carolina, yet it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry. Johnston proudly declares itself as the Peach Capital of the World, a claim featured on its welcome sign. The area is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two-story buildings with either metal roofs to combat the hot summer sun or gray shingles. Typically, these houses are set back from the road, with the front fields used for livestock or crops. In the town center, a single traffic light hangs over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town's only stores. \"Fast food\" options here include Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but has recently closed. There's a tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known humorously for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, leading many locals to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. Dollar General is the town's most popular store, bustling from open to close with its wide selection of daily necessities. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known local woman, has been a Johnston fixture for years and offers delivery service. Attached to this store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The only school is Johnston Elementary School, with middle and high school students attending classes in the neighboring town. While the town lacks parks, it is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more activities and attract visitors or new residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants, the town is endearing and small enough to pass through before you even notice!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I’ve become familiar with most of the residents. People typically occupy themselves with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that frequent the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we tend to notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids often ride their bikes, as you’d expect. We work from home, so we’re around a lot. Our family includes my wife, our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and myself. I assume the neighbors are accustomed to our comings and goings as well. We like to play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of grilling. From March to October, someone is always mowing their lawn, so the sound of a lawnmower is nearly constant. Originally a wooded area, our neighborhood has many trees offering ample shade, but they also bring plenty of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged autumn. Our garage is situated at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless there's a knock, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. The area is quite serene during holidays. Thanksgiving brings some families visiting from out of town, resulting in extra parked cars. The same occurs during holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt. Unless someone has lived here, they might not fully grasp what it's like to constantly see brown landscapes. A lawn is a rare sight, and when you do spot one, it’s clear that the owner is spending a lot on its maintenance. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely distributed. Although there are many new developments now, the spread-out nature remains. Honestly, this place increasingly resembles a city every day, but I suppose that's a common trend. Generally, people here are very friendly, though, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by amicable elderly people, making it a nicer area. The stores mostly consist of chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel; I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores nearby. Construction seems to be the most prevalent job in my city, though this is just my observation. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning as I prefer the current state. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. My job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty, among other reasons. The climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection, supporting various wildlife. Residents should learn about these non-human inhabitants to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write, they’re outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a fun and engaging time. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports activities to enjoy. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert can visit the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unique. While most people answering this question are likely homeowners with their own separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the residents of my dormitory are my community. I also include the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this difference, my neighborhood has similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. In my immediate area, there are three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around 2 floors, meaning roughly 20 people live in each building. Second, there are actual houses available for rent by those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, often rented by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are standard dorm rooms housing hundreds of students. Typically, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common housing type in my neighborhood. With housing described, we can move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while new students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students stay in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people here with mere words, so I'll move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has numerous stores and one park. The stores include a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's borders! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, maintained clean and safe by the community members themselves!",
            "There are few sidewalks in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my home is perched at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. It's known as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers include it in their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has some potholes and can feel a bit unsafe to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often damage the power lines, leading to constant repairs that make them look patchwork-like. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but residents don't like them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so sunlight is often seen through a mist. Most days are overcast and damp, causing moss to grow on everything, from roofs to cars and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in green moss that took three hours to remove. There aren't many children around, despite a school nearby. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs, which are often seen on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak inside. I once found one in my living room and had to escort it out. Rabbits roam freely here, and some are quite large, which gardeners dislike because they dig up plant roots and burrow in lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most out of the neighborhood. We also have typical birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, with an occasional hawk or eagle, though neighborhood crows usually chase them away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few seafood restaurants. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't find it hard to reach! Public transportation is easily available and is one of the most used ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban area, so you'll still experience the New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to see a variety of Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has experienced an increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll come across an Asian-owned store on nearly every block while walking. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are favored by locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food, the prices are significantly lower, and they provide convenience. Just near where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from one another, adding to the ease of getting groceries. However, I'm not suggesting Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is actually quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most of the major and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these, there's also a recently upgraded park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are very diverse, where everyone can play and interact well together. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The buildings you'll find are mainly co-op living spaces or condominium apartments. Most residences here are two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, although quite loud. Daily, you might hear cars with loud music passing by your house or revving their engines, which might wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay cautious. The neighborhood is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might encounter individuals looking to cause trouble, such as bullies and thieves. I have personally experienced bullying here in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which, although common, occur in this neighborhood. Finally, even though New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here often ignore this rule. Every morning, you might see at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is encountering dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you need to understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza restaurant, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less recognized and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite a wave of wealthy Californians moving in and the continuous rise of new condominiums to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always imply being accepting, but it does mean embracing things typically deemed unacceptable. It doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences or issues. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland also has its share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps being weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes usually contain items someone no longer wants, often placed in cardboard or plastic containers, offering a magical find, perfect for a passerby, more often than you'd expect. They often have clothes and books but can contain anything. The charm of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me, though I'm just one of many kinds of weird here. Some local residents wouldn't dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is teeming with people who have diverse interests. It's a place where people chase their dreams or dream of chasing them while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a challenge with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn here by the relatively better social services, though these services are still inadequate, as is the case nationwide. Residents' attitudes toward the homeless fluctuate between compassion and animosity, and in this regard, Portland isn't unique at all.",
            "The mountains remain constant, always present in the north, observing the sun's travels at dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them, preoccupied with work and life, they stand firm, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I gaze at them, they offer solace to my anxious heart, providing strength to carry on, one day at a time. When I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains near the campus were what initially captivated me. Although the university has its own stunning features, like its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way, with numerous cafés that served as venues for countless hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A brief walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an antique atmosphere that rivals the hustle and energy of the nearby city. This bustling vibe doesn't extend far, as one can quickly return to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments in close proximity gives the city a magical allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to form cherished memories linked to different parts of town, whether it's strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. However, like all places, it also holds harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as ideal spots for reflection or for tearful moments during existential crises at two in the morning, which I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects play their roles in life often led me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, the park, and the suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always, the towering mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—it's set in a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, a location not typically associated with housing. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are usually only filled during summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Within this neighborhood, the streets are lined with several apartment complexes, neatly arranged like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and aligned along the road. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory events, so we'll gloss over those—looks can be misleading. Next to them, though, are two other complexes that belong to a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where students, armed with coffee, arrive at 7 a.m., yawning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to welcome them, while commuters grumble and gesticulate at them for causing traffic delays on busy days. The road leads to another residential street, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from bone injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a gently spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children frolic in the park across the street, performing cartwheels and dashing across the grass, while bees meander among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the paths, frowning at teen skateboarders and smiling at the girls who are chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable meals but rarely seems crowded. Next to it, there's a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—a convenience provided by the strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold, dripping cups topped with treats as they skateboard and vape, believing it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a historical piece in the quiet South where things remain unchanged, even time itself.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most of the homes are single-family, although some have been divided into two connected units, if that makes sense. My house has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it reminds you of a time not too long ago when suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the people of this country, but now it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, still exists, still beckoning us and visitors to believe that the dream is alive, and we're holding onto it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the little yards aren't as well-maintained, but there are still a couple of cars in every driveway, and children play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. Each home looks different but feels the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, interest waned, and it turned into a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted rate, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but cherished by the older folks who appreciate a reasonably priced night out, sans kids. An expressway cuts through my town, though the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would disrupt the town, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is very diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, which host a variety of businesses. These businesses include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. Some shops are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, while small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and along streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods that are surrounded by numerous attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks frequented by people with young children. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite notable, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my neighborhood, there are many more individuals from various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away, but even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in the city because, despite some attractions being close, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. As a result, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and parking is challenging to find. Despite this, there has been significant construction recently, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. This trend makes it a popular destination, but many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increasing traffic. The city offers a variety of housing, as not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, which is true even in my immediate neighborhood, showcasing a diversity of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I remember playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were my age during my childhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk away—never before had she encountered so much open space. As she marveled at the expansive cornfields, I recounted my experiences growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally understood my roots. Traveling down a two-lane country road, we arrived at a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes, mainly made of brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of well-tended land. During spring, the area is vibrant with annually planted flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sparkling Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed and gleaming in the midday sun. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, was outside, usually spending the day mowing his lawn and singing over the sound of his mower. The neighborhood finds amusement in his antics, but he is genuinely kind and has an intriguing past. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam while our Terrier chases after them. Behind the house, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the flowing water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched paradise brimming with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly just chasing them), there was always an adventure, often shared with neighborhood friends. Winters in my town can be harsh yet stunning. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. Trees once adorned with vibrant blossoms become bare. When snow falls, it creates a magical wonderland overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We often bickered as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We constructed igloo-like forts for our snowball stash, usually using branches. In our private wonderland, we played and imagined, free from worries, simply being carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most stunning locations in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is encircled by water, with beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. No matter where you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood exemplifies the essence of a small town. Houses are not crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, with some being updated and remodeled while others retain their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the area have older aluminum siding. The blocks around my house feature homes in every color you can imagine. Most houses have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America, where hardworking people strive to make a living and are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, you will see children running along the streets, as well as people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. You might see someone grilling outside and wave, or encounter someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and exchange a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left over from fall. The grass is green, mowed, and tidy. If there are plants and bushes in the yards, they are neatly trimmed. It isn't a neighborhood that impresses with stunning homes, but rather one that gives the impression of being a great place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it may look average, it is exceptional because it embodies what people desire—a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is right next to them. The city recycling center is a short distance away, providing services to locals and city residents. We have nearby baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and player names. Our small-town airport is adjacent to these fields. You can be indoors or out and hear the rumble of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is about 8 blocks away. It really is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburb with a uniform appearance. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll only see well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the association's efforts. The front yards look quite similar, featuring small patches of manicured grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads. Despite various families living here, the streets are kept in excellent shape, free from potholes. While most houses are single-story, there are some two-story ones as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each home, there is a communal mailbox setup similar to apartments, with a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, each accessible by key, and a couple of larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is again thanks to the HOA. My house is situated on the city's outskirts, making the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, there's ample space for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple well-maintained and gated community pools. There are also several walking trails, perfect for walking your dog or enjoying a solitary evening stroll, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is large enough for a good run. The community mostly consists of retirees, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals as well. The nearby city is quite large population-wise but retains a small-town vibe. It offers most standard amenities, including a single mall that, while not massive, is adequate. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of shops to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited stock and minimal staffing to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and fairly typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. While we're not immediately next to shopping areas, a short drive will take you to any major retailer you desire.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was from a podcast discussing missing people. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither I nor my friends had heard about that story before. Maybe it’s the challenge. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high costs, but over time, we’ve become skilled at being thrifty. You grow fond of the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that smell of mothballs. As adults, we tend to notice smells less. You might pick up smoking, or simply become used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market's presence is always felt. The scent of adulthood resembles old magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself into leather and lingers even after washing. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio store. Downtown is bustling, crowded with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the shops remain silent. It’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city grows busier, filled with cars and people. They call it a developing city, home to one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still adjusting to growth. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own objectives, and not much is expected of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and self-reliant, and people will respect your space. It’s unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, you don’t intrude into others’ lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It’s an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In some ways, we’re less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and look out for each other. It’s nice to see them, and I think they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern city, it’s neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven’t completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, located just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the east side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area here. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amicable, often greeting me with smiles and hellos as I walk by. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has only been indirectly affected by crime, with occasional items disappearing from our porch if left out. Overall, our town has been deeply impacted by the opioid crisis that has afflicted many areas in the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are many resources available here to address this issue, including several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town offers many positives. My son’s elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not experienced any bullying due to the school’s incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. The PTO is active, organizing numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational growth. With over 20% of the town’s population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town’s appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these efforts have been concentrated in the town center and west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are located, leaving the east side where I live somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. Despite these issues, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are plenty of shopping options, ranging from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family’s needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Nestled on a hill, it's surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill is a charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends, especially in June and July, you often see lines of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious given its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. While it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, keeps them warmer. They are also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing and showering facilities. What I love about my city is not just the charm of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered throughout the hills rolling toward the ocean. What I truly cherish about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous as the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast due to gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these events, and tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders that plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood is typical of an American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is generally quiet during the week. I've never had issues with anyone here; people leave you alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online without any being stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from the park when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the positive memories outweigh that. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now brings me a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of nearby food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine within a mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned shop for those wanting to cook or buy Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading horror stories about neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to my college. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, along with some fun and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit more expensive, but the quality of drinks and service is decent. The people here are generally nice; many are college students or from lower-income backgrounds, as the apartments are quite affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors well, nor do I wish to, as they smoke a lot of weed. The management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and almost offensive. The buildings in the area mostly look old but might have updated interiors. There are new apartments down the street, but I dislike them because they're poorly constructed yet expensive to rent, which seems like a rip-off considering their proximity to campus. There's a very cheap restaurant about five minutes away that uses paper plates and mostly serves microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. Fortunately, the city funded improvements last summer, so the roads have new sidewalks and grassy medians, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind us is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. Although there are many trees, they seem to hide the buildings' poor appearance. Most crimes occur at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I can't solely blame them since the apartments across from me also experience crime and have a transient population. Overall, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities nearby. I appreciate being within walking distance of the university and having two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes are scattered along a cul-de-sac, designed to resemble individual houses. They all share a uniform look, painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, and on some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway for casual chats while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This setting offers a refreshing contrast to the modern, tech-driven world, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The area is surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog stayed nervously in the living room, barking at the unusual situation. The only sounds outside were of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, melting the hail upon impact. As the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared, prompting me to dash inside for my camera to capture the moment and share it on Facebook, where it amazed my friends and family. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm, and life resumed with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. This welcoming neighborhood is a joy for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I love the local southern accent. Everyone here has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors differ, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and down to the non-swimmable pond. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, the giant bullfrog can be heard singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms, adding to the village-like feel of the community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share my experiences. When I first arrived in my neighborhood, I was quite sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t deny it—I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and schools, a location that was considered “not ghetto.” Over time, I adapted, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, since they lived next door. They’ve been wonderful people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got remarried) with my family. It was incredibly fun, and I look forward to having a similar experience someday, as I work to build a prosperous life for my future wife. At the wedding, when Ms. Veda tossed the garter, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s doing well in life. My neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. My exploration has mostly been with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of life. I sometimes visit the park to enjoy nature, which brings me peace and calm. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword when I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are basketball and tennis courts too, though I haven’t played in a while. It’s nice to have the option if I want to try again. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I’ve had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and while there are many stories to tell, these are the highlights. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town that doesn't particularly stand out from others in South Carolina, yet it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry. Johnston proudly declares itself as the Peach Capital of the World, a claim featured on its welcome sign. The area is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two-story buildings with either metal roofs to combat the hot summer sun or gray shingles. Typically, these houses are set back from the road, with the front fields used for livestock or crops. In the town center, a single traffic light hangs over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town's only stores. \"Fast food\" options here include Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but has recently closed. There's a tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known humorously for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, leading many locals to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. Dollar General is the town's most popular store, bustling from open to close with its wide selection of daily necessities. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known local woman, has been a Johnston fixture for years and offers delivery service. Attached to this store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The only school is Johnston Elementary School, with middle and high school students attending classes in the neighboring town. While the town lacks parks, it is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more activities and attract visitors or new residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants, the town is endearing and small enough to pass through before you even notice!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I’ve become familiar with most of the residents. People typically occupy themselves with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that frequent the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we tend to notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids often ride their bikes, as you’d expect. We work from home, so we’re around a lot. Our family includes my wife, our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and myself. I assume the neighbors are accustomed to our comings and goings as well. We like to play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of grilling. From March to October, someone is always mowing their lawn, so the sound of a lawnmower is nearly constant. Originally a wooded area, our neighborhood has many trees offering ample shade, but they also bring plenty of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged autumn. Our garage is situated at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless there's a knock, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. The area is quite serene during holidays. Thanksgiving brings some families visiting from out of town, resulting in extra parked cars. The same occurs during holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt. Unless someone has lived here, they might not fully grasp what it's like to constantly see brown landscapes. A lawn is a rare sight, and when you do spot one, it’s clear that the owner is spending a lot on its maintenance. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely distributed. Although there are many new developments now, the spread-out nature remains. Honestly, this place increasingly resembles a city every day, but I suppose that's a common trend. Generally, people here are very friendly, though, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by amicable elderly people, making it a nicer area. The stores mostly consist of chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel; I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores nearby. Construction seems to be the most prevalent job in my city, though this is just my observation. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning as I prefer the current state. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. My job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty, among other reasons. The climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection, supporting various wildlife. Residents should learn about these non-human inhabitants to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write, they’re outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a fun and engaging time. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports activities to enjoy. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert can visit the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unique. While most people answering this question are likely homeowners with their own separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the residents of my dormitory are my community. I also include the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this difference, my neighborhood has similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. In my immediate area, there are three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around 2 floors, meaning roughly 20 people live in each building. Second, there are actual houses available for rent by those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, often rented by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are standard dorm rooms housing hundreds of students. Typically, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common housing type in my neighborhood. With housing described, we can move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while new students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students stay in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people here with mere words, so I'll move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has numerous stores and one park. The stores include a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's borders! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, maintained clean and safe by the community members themselves!",
            "There are few sidewalks in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my home is perched at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. It's known as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers include it in their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has some potholes and can feel a bit unsafe to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often damage the power lines, leading to constant repairs that make them look patchwork-like. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but residents don't like them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so sunlight is often seen through a mist. Most days are overcast and damp, causing moss to grow on everything, from roofs to cars and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in green moss that took three hours to remove. There aren't many children around, despite a school nearby. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs, which are often seen on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak inside. I once found one in my living room and had to escort it out. Rabbits roam freely here, and some are quite large, which gardeners dislike because they dig up plant roots and burrow in lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most out of the neighborhood. We also have typical birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, with an occasional hawk or eagle, though neighborhood crows usually chase them away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few seafood restaurants. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't find it hard to reach! Public transportation is easily available and is one of the most used ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban area, so you'll still experience the New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to see a variety of Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has experienced an increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll come across an Asian-owned store on nearly every block while walking. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are favored by locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food, the prices are significantly lower, and they provide convenience. Just near where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from one another, adding to the ease of getting groceries. However, I'm not suggesting Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is actually quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most of the major and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these, there's also a recently upgraded park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are very diverse, where everyone can play and interact well together. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The buildings you'll find are mainly co-op living spaces or condominium apartments. Most residences here are two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, although quite loud. Daily, you might hear cars with loud music passing by your house or revving their engines, which might wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay cautious. The neighborhood is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might encounter individuals looking to cause trouble, such as bullies and thieves. I have personally experienced bullying here in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which, although common, occur in this neighborhood. Finally, even though New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here often ignore this rule. Every morning, you might see at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is encountering dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you need to understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza restaurant, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less recognized and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite a wave of wealthy Californians moving in and the continuous rise of new condominiums to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always imply being accepting, but it does mean embracing things typically deemed unacceptable. It doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences or issues. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland also has its share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps being weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes usually contain items someone no longer wants, often placed in cardboard or plastic containers, offering a magical find, perfect for a passerby, more often than you'd expect. They often have clothes and books but can contain anything. The charm of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me, though I'm just one of many kinds of weird here. Some local residents wouldn't dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is teeming with people who have diverse interests. It's a place where people chase their dreams or dream of chasing them while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a challenge with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn here by the relatively better social services, though these services are still inadequate, as is the case nationwide. Residents' attitudes toward the homeless fluctuate between compassion and animosity, and in this regard, Portland isn't unique at all.",
            "The mountains remain constant, always present in the north, observing the sun's travels at dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them, preoccupied with work and life, they stand firm, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I gaze at them, they offer solace to my anxious heart, providing strength to carry on, one day at a time. When I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains near the campus were what initially captivated me. Although the university has its own stunning features, like its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way, with numerous cafés that served as venues for countless hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A brief walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an antique atmosphere that rivals the hustle and energy of the nearby city. This bustling vibe doesn't extend far, as one can quickly return to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments in close proximity gives the city a magical allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to form cherished memories linked to different parts of town, whether it's strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. However, like all places, it also holds harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as ideal spots for reflection or for tearful moments during existential crises at two in the morning, which I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects play their roles in life often led me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, the park, and the suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always, the towering mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—it's set in a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, a location not typically associated with housing. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are usually only filled during summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Within this neighborhood, the streets are lined with several apartment complexes, neatly arranged like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and aligned along the road. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory events, so we'll gloss over those—looks can be misleading. Next to them, though, are two other complexes that belong to a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where students, armed with coffee, arrive at 7 a.m., yawning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to welcome them, while commuters grumble and gesticulate at them for causing traffic delays on busy days. The road leads to another residential street, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from bone injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a gently spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children frolic in the park across the street, performing cartwheels and dashing across the grass, while bees meander among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the paths, frowning at teen skateboarders and smiling at the girls who are chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable meals but rarely seems crowded. Next to it, there's a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—a convenience provided by the strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold, dripping cups topped with treats as they skateboard and vape, believing it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a historical piece in the quiet South where things remain unchanged, even time itself.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most of the homes are single-family, although some have been divided into two connected units, if that makes sense. My house has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it reminds you of a time not too long ago when suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the people of this country, but now it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, still exists, still beckoning us and visitors to believe that the dream is alive, and we're holding onto it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the little yards aren't as well-maintained, but there are still a couple of cars in every driveway, and children play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. Each home looks different but feels the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, interest waned, and it turned into a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted rate, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but cherished by the older folks who appreciate a reasonably priced night out, sans kids. An expressway cuts through my town, though the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would disrupt the town, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is very diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, which host a variety of businesses. These businesses include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. Some shops are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, while small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and along streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods that are surrounded by numerous attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks frequented by people with young children. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite notable, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my neighborhood, there are many more individuals from various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away, but even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in the city because, despite some attractions being close, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. As a result, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and parking is challenging to find. Despite this, there has been significant construction recently, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. This trend makes it a popular destination, but many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increasing traffic. The city offers a variety of housing, as not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, which is true even in my immediate neighborhood, showcasing a diversity of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I remember playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were my age during my childhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk away—never before had she encountered so much open space. As she marveled at the expansive cornfields, I recounted my experiences growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally understood my roots. Traveling down a two-lane country road, we arrived at a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes, mainly made of brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of well-tended land. During spring, the area is vibrant with annually planted flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sparkling Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed and gleaming in the midday sun. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, was outside, usually spending the day mowing his lawn and singing over the sound of his mower. The neighborhood finds amusement in his antics, but he is genuinely kind and has an intriguing past. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam while our Terrier chases after them. Behind the house, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the flowing water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched paradise brimming with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly just chasing them), there was always an adventure, often shared with neighborhood friends. Winters in my town can be harsh yet stunning. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. Trees once adorned with vibrant blossoms become bare. When snow falls, it creates a magical wonderland overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We often bickered as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We constructed igloo-like forts for our snowball stash, usually using branches. In our private wonderland, we played and imagined, free from worries, simply being carefree children."

Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Every destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most beautiful locations, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by water, with stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches where you can dip your toes are everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses aren't packed closely together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some remodeled and some retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street. Many homes feature older aluminum siding, and in the surrounding blocks, houses come in every imaginable color. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America—hardworking people making a living, raising or having raised families. On any day, you'll see children playing in the streets and people walking dogs, cycling, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and it’s easy to tell who belongs. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a smile with someone walking their dog from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, without leaves left over from fall. Green grass is neatly mowed, and plants and bushes are trimmed. While the neighborhood isn't strikingly beautiful, it's a place where you'd think it'd be ideal to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though average in appearance, it is outstanding for being a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff’s department and jail. Next to that is the Health Department. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving local residents. Nearby, there are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is adjacent to these fields, allowing you to hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside resembles a typical suburban setting, characterized by uniformity. In my particular neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, a result of the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each home includes a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads, free of potholes, despite the various families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's focus on uniformity is responsible for this setup. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to exercise; the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mostly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for each other. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population, yet it retains a small-town feel with most amenities available. We have one mall that, while not enormous, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where numerous shopping options await. There are high-end grocery stores offering organic products and discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, featuring nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we aren't immediately adjacent to shopping centers, you can easily drive to any major chain store you need.",
            "The first time I learned about my apartment, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment around here costs over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends end up crying themselves to sleep. Life is pricey, but over time, we've mastered the art of frugality. You begin to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes stored away with mothballs. As adults, we notice odors less. You might take up smoking, or perhaps you're just used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market always makes its presence known. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. This scent clings to leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. Despite the traffic outside, they're quiet. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. They say it's a city on the rise, home to one of the largest online empires in e-commerce and delivery, yet still grappling with growth challenges. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own objectives, and few demand anything from you. You can be solitary, silent, and self-reliant, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude on others' lives. You can maintain your protective shell as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like ocean waves. It's an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, our apartment is less of a place filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and lend a hand when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure I clean up after myself, share food with them, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but it's neighbors like mine who make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban outskirts of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is the most economically challenged area. The property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only experienced minor incidents, such as the occasional theft from our porch when items are left out. The town as a whole has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" prevalent in many parts of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, our town offers ample resources to tackle this crisis, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for loved ones of those affected by addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive features. My son's elementary school has an excellent team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's positive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys attending. The active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family faces discrimination for an inability to pay, and school-related costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements have mainly been centralized in the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a concern for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options, both small businesses and larger stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suitable. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Situated on a hill, it is surrounded by buildings of historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill, there's a charming little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this part of town. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains of mid-winter make staying warm difficult. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, helps keep them warmer. They're also within walking and transit distance of the only family center for miles, where they can wash up. What I cherish about my city isn't just the historical beauty—the towering buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills descending to the ocean. What I truly love about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast. Even now, three decades later, stories circulate about federal and DEA agents sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these tales, passing them down to newcomers like me. Although Hilltop is still considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness. They care deeply about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is an echo of the past, tinged with social conditioning's bitterness. Perhaps it's because I can pass as not completely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own—someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born from ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself on being a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, give me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually grew close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Those friends have since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with numerous two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, you can hear children playing outside, but it's generally quiet during the week. I’ve never had any issues with my neighbors; they leave you alone unless you need assistance. I often order packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I have many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories happened there, too, when I got hit in the nose while playing football, but the positive memories far outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who love the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park fills them with excitement, and it brings a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a mile. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for convenience, though fast food spots remain popular, as they are in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores provide everything you might need, with several dry cleaners and both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, alongside a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop perfect for purchasing ingredients or ready-made Indian meals. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few enjoyable and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently got a new name and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are generally friendly, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, since the apartment rents aren't high. There's an elementary school within walking distance, so there are many children around. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so management installed an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and slightly insulting. The surrounding buildings look old but might have updated interiors. A bit further down the street are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which I consider a scam. There's a cheap restaurant five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Opposite that is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the city-funded road improvements last summer added a nice sidewalk and greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some were cut down, leaving stumps, and there are more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, whereas 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings. The trees there likely conceal the buildings' conditions. Most local crime occurs at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but my street also has crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my living situation. It's affordable, and there are many convenient amenities nearby. I particularly appreciate that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged in a way that makes them resemble individual homes. However, they all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most residents are friends, often gathering at the end of an unspecified driveway in the evenings to chat while the local children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This social atmosphere is refreshing in our technology-driven world and feels like a step back in time. The neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and puffy clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard actual sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room barking. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared as the sun came out during a brief rain shower. I dashed inside to grab my camera and took pictures to share on Facebook, which amazed my friends and family, as it did me. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until people returned home after the storm. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents people have here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors vary in size, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and heading to the nearby pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening as a reminder of its presence. I feel fortunate to have found this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share my experiences. Initially, I was quite upset when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was heartbroken, but my parents wanted better opportunities for me and my sister, like an improved living area and a better high school, in a neighborhood perceived as more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, making new friends and some rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value their presence. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyful occasion. I even caught the garter, although I missed out on the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I especially enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's moved on to great things. The neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I now explore more than before, especially when hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We often played video games and lived life fully. Occasionally, I'd visit the park for some nature therapy, which brings me peace. I also practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken wooden sword. Although I haven't played basketball or tennis lately, it's nice to know the courts are there. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable moments here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that might not distinguish itself from others in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact displayed on the town's welcome sign. The area is predominantly farmland, featuring peach trees and cattle. Houses outside the town's center are spaced far apart, mostly two-story buildings with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing the front land to be used for livestock or crops. In the town's center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection where the few local stores are found. You can grab \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's only grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is small and pricey. Many residents prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-loved local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and provides delivery services with two movers. Attached to the furniture store is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There's a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice outside the main town area, both well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston has just one elementary school, and students must go to the next town for middle and high school. Although there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to offer more family-friendly activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide range of restaurants, Johnston remains a pleasant town that can be missed in the blink of an eye.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but despite that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's not much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people living here. Residents often engage in yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars that locals drive. When we notice an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to keep an eye on it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out, and kids play on bikes, as you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from there. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. This means the neighborhood is also accustomed to our comings and goings. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. There's almost always someone mowing the lawn here, with the sound of lawnmowers audible nearly every day from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing plenty of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Since our garage is at the back of our house, we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's similar for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood lies right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to really grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a green lawn, it's clear that person is spending a fortune on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that hasn't changed much, there's been a lot of new development. Honestly, this place is beginning to resemble a city more and more each day, but I suppose that’s a trend happening everywhere. Generally, the people are quite friendly, though like any city, there are both good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I’m surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores around here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you’re looking for upscale shopping, you have to travel a bit further; I rarely see Whole Foods or similar stores. The jobs that seem most common in my city, without relying on official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because the city is still not fully developed, with lots of open spaces available for building. That prospect unnerves me since I like things the way they are now. I left a large city and I'm not eager to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in this field as I install drywall and T-bar. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for numerous reasons, one of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert’s climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about the wildlife inhabiting this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Moreover, Victorville is a great place for families to explore the desert, offering unique experiences. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair, which will enhance your visit with a mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons to complete your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that narrate the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also consider the greater campus area as my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that form my neighborhood. Before diving into the houses, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room typically accommodates 2-4 people, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common buildings have around 2 floors, hosting about 20 people each. Second, there are the actual houses that anyone connected to the school can rent. These usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the standard dorm rooms which house hundreds of students, with two sharing a room, generally speaking. This is the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, reflected in my neighborhood's demographic. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most of the professional staff live in the houses within the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. It’s hard to fully capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood through mere words, so let’s move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers numerous shops and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, alongside the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. The terrain slopes downward, and my home is perched at the top of the steepest hill nearby. Locals nickname it the \"work out hill\" since many joggers choose it for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which is pothole-ridden and somewhat risky for driving. The telephone and power lines in the neighborhood appear worn and patched up. Frequent storms and rainfall cause branches and debris to often damage the lines, leading to repeated repairs that give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are abundant, but residents dislike them because they block the ocean view. Consequently, many homes are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The area is breathtaking at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's mostly cloudy, with the sun often seen through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, and moss thrives on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and it became covered in moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in the vicinity, despite a nearby school. Most residents are older and retired, preferring dogs over children. It's typical to see dogs lounging on lawns or playing in the street. Leaving a door or window open can result in dogs entering your home; I once found one in my living room. Rabbits are plentiful and roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay, as they damage plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in the neighborhood. We also see various birds, from sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks or eagles appear until crows drive them away. There are no stores nearby, but a downhill walk to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be challenging! Public transportation is highly accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a predominantly urban area, so you'll still feel the vibrant atmosphere of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit, as the neighborhood has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. You'll come across at least one Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are favored by locals for their excellent food quality, lower prices, and convenience. In my vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of shopping for groceries. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely inhabited by Asian residents; it's a diverse community with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. While many of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a newly renovated park nearby featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given we're in New York City, the park is naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. In Bensonhurst, you won't find many large corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op or condominium apartment buildings, with most housing being two-family homes. The residents are generally friendly but quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or speeding by, which may wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise caution. Although the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault here years ago, and package theft is a recent issue. Despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, the rule isn't always followed here. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest frustration is the prevalence of dog waste throughout the neighborhood. Be mindful to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is all about, you must first understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes bending the rules—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was more obscure, affordable, and a breeding ground for creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos built for them, Portland retains its quirks. Being weird here doesn't necessarily mean being universally accepting, but it does imply embracing what is typically not accepted. It doesn’t mean the absence of modern conveniences or struggles; like other places, Portland buys most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy the norm, yet Portland is also quite ordinary, with yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird here means not taking things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many around Portland, you’ll find vibrant houses, gardens lining the streets with flowers and produce, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs, often containing something serendipitously fitting for a passerby. They usually hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. This enchanting possibility of discovery defines Portland for me, though I am just one of countless expressions of weird. Some locals would never consider picking clothes out of a sidewalk box; they might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is home to people with diverse passions, who chase their dreams—or dream of doing so, while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, there’s a drug issue, often linked to mental health challenges, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also faces a homelessness crisis, with few solutions in sight. The homeless community is drawn by the city’s relatively better social services, which remain inadequate, as is the case nationwide. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast. In the north, they silently observe the sun's passage at each dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become preoccupied with the busyness of work and life, they remain, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress overwhelms me, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, granting me the strength to persevere, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate years, and it was the northern mountains near the campus that initially captivated me. Certainly, the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, but it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way. There are numerous cafés where many caffeine-fueled study sessions took place. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area immerses you in an old-world charm with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals as much energy and activity as its neighboring urban city. However, this liveliness only spans a few blocks, after which you can retreat once more to the tranquil small-town feel by passing the library. This close proximity of contrasting atmospheres gives the city an enchanting vibe, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-night study session or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the elegant theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it also holds its share of painful memories, as all places inevitably do in life. The ponds, for instance, can be an ideal spot for reflection or for tearful moments at two in the morning during an existential crisis—something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I struggled to navigate the enigma of life. So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its radiant light atop the palm trees, painting the sky in its wake, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they rekindled my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip isn’t typically where you’d expect to find homes. Certainly not desirable ones. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue around the hotels that fill up only during the summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets are several apartment complexes, lined up meticulously like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged side by side. The first set of apartments has been in the news for some less-than-flattering reasons, so let’s not dwell on them—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the adjacent complexes offer a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet cluster of buildings where students trickle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. as they start their day. The gates open slowly to let them in, while drivers nearby express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road extends into another residential street, flanked by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a leisurely spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees drift among the flowers nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the young girls gathered by the playground, chattering about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Next to the park, there’s a sushi restaurant in a strip mall with affordable food that rarely seems crowded. A swimming supply store and a nail salon are nearby, allowing you to prep your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and some hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens frequently hang out, holding their chilled cups heaped with toppings as they perform skateboard tricks and vape, thinking it’s the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of American life—a piece of history in the unchanging, tranquil South.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but a few have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes any sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to encompass the people of this nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors to believe the dream is alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as before, the maintenance of small yards has waned, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, nurturing a future in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but basketball courts are bustling. Although each home looks different, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket named Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family here, while the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy—because, apparently, drugs solve everything, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater showing old films at reduced prices, avoided by the youth who dislike its lack of new releases but appreciated by elders who find it a small price for a night out, sans kids. An expressway runs through my town, though the exit and entrance lie in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the youth supported it, but the elders opposed it, claiming an expressway exit would spoil the town. Their persuasion led the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being constructed, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed, seemingly at random, with commercial zones where a wide array of businesses operate. These businesses include offices, various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of new dining options and shops to explore. While some stores belong to large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods, made lively by nearby attractions. There are a couple of parks nearby, which are popular spots for families with young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse, featuring a significant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are even more people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk in the city, as it is vast, and most prefer not to travel on foot. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and parking can be challenging to find anywhere. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Despite this, there is a variety of housing options, not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of various ages, and honestly, I'm not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the neighborhood who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is all there is!\" I responded, aware that the vast openness would surprise her. She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was just a short five-minute walk from her home—she had never experienced such expansive space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a narrow country road, you will come across a quarry filled with water, and just beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, there is an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. The driveways boast high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that sparkle in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue toward my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing his lawn, singing above the sound of his mower. He is the source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely a wonderful person with an interesting history. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower as he has aged and lost some of his sharpness. Eventually, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese abound, pursued by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water, and an occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals—mostly just chasing them—there was always something to do, often with a neighborhood friend. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they possess a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blooms become skeletal structures of bark. When snow occasionally falls, it transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels crafted by my little sister, along with snowmen. As kids, my sister and I often argued, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We built large igloo-like forts to store our 'ammunition,' using branches like an arsenal. In this little wonderland, we played pretend, at a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Every destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most beautiful locations, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by water, with stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches where you can dip your toes are everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses aren't packed closely together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some remodeled and some retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street. Many homes feature older aluminum siding, and in the surrounding blocks, houses come in every imaginable color. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America—hardworking people making a living, raising or having raised families. On any day, you'll see children playing in the streets and people walking dogs, cycling, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and it’s easy to tell who belongs. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a smile with someone walking their dog from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, without leaves left over from fall. Green grass is neatly mowed, and plants and bushes are trimmed. While the neighborhood isn't strikingly beautiful, it's a place where you'd think it'd be ideal to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though average in appearance, it is outstanding for being a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff’s department and jail. Next to that is the Health Department. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving local residents. Nearby, there are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is adjacent to these fields, allowing you to hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside resembles a typical suburban setting, characterized by uniformity. In my particular neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, a result of the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each home includes a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads, free of potholes, despite the various families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's focus on uniformity is responsible for this setup. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to exercise; the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mostly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for each other. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population, yet it retains a small-town feel with most amenities available. We have one mall that, while not enormous, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where numerous shopping options await. There are high-end grocery stores offering organic products and discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, featuring nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we aren't immediately adjacent to shopping centers, you can easily drive to any major chain store you need.",
            "The first time I learned about my apartment, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment around here costs over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends end up crying themselves to sleep. Life is pricey, but over time, we've mastered the art of frugality. You begin to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes stored away with mothballs. As adults, we notice odors less. You might take up smoking, or perhaps you're just used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market always makes its presence known. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. This scent clings to leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. Despite the traffic outside, they're quiet. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. They say it's a city on the rise, home to one of the largest online empires in e-commerce and delivery, yet still grappling with growth challenges. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own objectives, and few demand anything from you. You can be solitary, silent, and self-reliant, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude on others' lives. You can maintain your protective shell as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like ocean waves. It's an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, our apartment is less of a place filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and lend a hand when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure I clean up after myself, share food with them, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but it's neighbors like mine who make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban outskirts of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is the most economically challenged area. The property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only experienced minor incidents, such as the occasional theft from our porch when items are left out. The town as a whole has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" prevalent in many parts of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, our town offers ample resources to tackle this crisis, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for loved ones of those affected by addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive features. My son's elementary school has an excellent team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's positive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys attending. The active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family faces discrimination for an inability to pay, and school-related costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements have mainly been centralized in the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a concern for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options, both small businesses and larger stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suitable. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Situated on a hill, it is surrounded by buildings of historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill, there's a charming little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this part of town. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains of mid-winter make staying warm difficult. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, helps keep them warmer. They're also within walking and transit distance of the only family center for miles, where they can wash up. What I cherish about my city isn't just the historical beauty—the towering buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills descending to the ocean. What I truly love about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast. Even now, three decades later, stories circulate about federal and DEA agents sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these tales, passing them down to newcomers like me. Although Hilltop is still considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness. They care deeply about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is an echo of the past, tinged with social conditioning's bitterness. Perhaps it's because I can pass as not completely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own—someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born from ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself on being a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, give me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually grew close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Those friends have since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with numerous two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, you can hear children playing outside, but it's generally quiet during the week. I’ve never had any issues with my neighbors; they leave you alone unless you need assistance. I often order packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I have many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories happened there, too, when I got hit in the nose while playing football, but the positive memories far outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who love the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park fills them with excitement, and it brings a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a mile. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for convenience, though fast food spots remain popular, as they are in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores provide everything you might need, with several dry cleaners and both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, alongside a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop perfect for purchasing ingredients or ready-made Indian meals. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few enjoyable and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently got a new name and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are generally friendly, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, since the apartment rents aren't high. There's an elementary school within walking distance, so there are many children around. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so management installed an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and slightly insulting. The surrounding buildings look old but might have updated interiors. A bit further down the street are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which I consider a scam. There's a cheap restaurant five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Opposite that is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the city-funded road improvements last summer added a nice sidewalk and greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some were cut down, leaving stumps, and there are more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, whereas 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings. The trees there likely conceal the buildings' conditions. Most local crime occurs at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but my street also has crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my living situation. It's affordable, and there are many convenient amenities nearby. I particularly appreciate that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged in a way that makes them resemble individual homes. However, they all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most residents are friends, often gathering at the end of an unspecified driveway in the evenings to chat while the local children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This social atmosphere is refreshing in our technology-driven world and feels like a step back in time. The neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and puffy clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard actual sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room barking. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared as the sun came out during a brief rain shower. I dashed inside to grab my camera and took pictures to share on Facebook, which amazed my friends and family, as it did me. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until people returned home after the storm. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents people have here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors vary in size, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and heading to the nearby pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening as a reminder of its presence. I feel fortunate to have found this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share my experiences. Initially, I was quite upset when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was heartbroken, but my parents wanted better opportunities for me and my sister, like an improved living area and a better high school, in a neighborhood perceived as more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, making new friends and some rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value their presence. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyful occasion. I even caught the garter, although I missed out on the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I especially enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's moved on to great things. The neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I now explore more than before, especially when hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We often played video games and lived life fully. Occasionally, I'd visit the park for some nature therapy, which brings me peace. I also practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken wooden sword. Although I haven't played basketball or tennis lately, it's nice to know the courts are there. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable moments here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that might not distinguish itself from others in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact displayed on the town's welcome sign. The area is predominantly farmland, featuring peach trees and cattle. Houses outside the town's center are spaced far apart, mostly two-story buildings with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing the front land to be used for livestock or crops. In the town's center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection where the few local stores are found. You can grab \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's only grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is small and pricey. Many residents prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-loved local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and provides delivery services with two movers. Attached to the furniture store is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There's a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice outside the main town area, both well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston has just one elementary school, and students must go to the next town for middle and high school. Although there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to offer more family-friendly activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide range of restaurants, Johnston remains a pleasant town that can be missed in the blink of an eye.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but despite that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's not much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people living here. Residents often engage in yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars that locals drive. When we notice an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to keep an eye on it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out, and kids play on bikes, as you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from there. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. This means the neighborhood is also accustomed to our comings and goings. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. There's almost always someone mowing the lawn here, with the sound of lawnmowers audible nearly every day from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing plenty of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Since our garage is at the back of our house, we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's similar for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood lies right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to really grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a green lawn, it's clear that person is spending a fortune on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that hasn't changed much, there's been a lot of new development. Honestly, this place is beginning to resemble a city more and more each day, but I suppose that’s a trend happening everywhere. Generally, the people are quite friendly, though like any city, there are both good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I’m surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores around here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you’re looking for upscale shopping, you have to travel a bit further; I rarely see Whole Foods or similar stores. The jobs that seem most common in my city, without relying on official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because the city is still not fully developed, with lots of open spaces available for building. That prospect unnerves me since I like things the way they are now. I left a large city and I'm not eager to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in this field as I install drywall and T-bar. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for numerous reasons, one of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert’s climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about the wildlife inhabiting this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Moreover, Victorville is a great place for families to explore the desert, offering unique experiences. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair, which will enhance your visit with a mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons to complete your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that narrate the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also consider the greater campus area as my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that form my neighborhood. Before diving into the houses, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room typically accommodates 2-4 people, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common buildings have around 2 floors, hosting about 20 people each. Second, there are the actual houses that anyone connected to the school can rent. These usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the standard dorm rooms which house hundreds of students, with two sharing a room, generally speaking. This is the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, reflected in my neighborhood's demographic. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most of the professional staff live in the houses within the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. It’s hard to fully capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood through mere words, so let’s move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers numerous shops and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, alongside the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. The terrain slopes downward, and my home is perched at the top of the steepest hill nearby. Locals nickname it the \"work out hill\" since many joggers choose it for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which is pothole-ridden and somewhat risky for driving. The telephone and power lines in the neighborhood appear worn and patched up. Frequent storms and rainfall cause branches and debris to often damage the lines, leading to repeated repairs that give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are abundant, but residents dislike them because they block the ocean view. Consequently, many homes are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The area is breathtaking at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's mostly cloudy, with the sun often seen through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, and moss thrives on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and it became covered in moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in the vicinity, despite a nearby school. Most residents are older and retired, preferring dogs over children. It's typical to see dogs lounging on lawns or playing in the street. Leaving a door or window open can result in dogs entering your home; I once found one in my living room. Rabbits are plentiful and roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay, as they damage plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in the neighborhood. We also see various birds, from sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks or eagles appear until crows drive them away. There are no stores nearby, but a downhill walk to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be challenging! Public transportation is highly accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a predominantly urban area, so you'll still feel the vibrant atmosphere of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit, as the neighborhood has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. You'll come across at least one Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are favored by locals for their excellent food quality, lower prices, and convenience. In my vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of shopping for groceries. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely inhabited by Asian residents; it's a diverse community with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. While many of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a newly renovated park nearby featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given we're in New York City, the park is naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. In Bensonhurst, you won't find many large corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op or condominium apartment buildings, with most housing being two-family homes. The residents are generally friendly but quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or speeding by, which may wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise caution. Although the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault here years ago, and package theft is a recent issue. Despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, the rule isn't always followed here. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest frustration is the prevalence of dog waste throughout the neighborhood. Be mindful to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is all about, you must first understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes bending the rules—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was more obscure, affordable, and a breeding ground for creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos built for them, Portland retains its quirks. Being weird here doesn't necessarily mean being universally accepting, but it does imply embracing what is typically not accepted. It doesn’t mean the absence of modern conveniences or struggles; like other places, Portland buys most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy the norm, yet Portland is also quite ordinary, with yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird here means not taking things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many around Portland, you’ll find vibrant houses, gardens lining the streets with flowers and produce, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs, often containing something serendipitously fitting for a passerby. They usually hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. This enchanting possibility of discovery defines Portland for me, though I am just one of countless expressions of weird. Some locals would never consider picking clothes out of a sidewalk box; they might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is home to people with diverse passions, who chase their dreams—or dream of doing so, while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, there’s a drug issue, often linked to mental health challenges, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also faces a homelessness crisis, with few solutions in sight. The homeless community is drawn by the city’s relatively better social services, which remain inadequate, as is the case nationwide. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast. In the north, they silently observe the sun's passage at each dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become preoccupied with the busyness of work and life, they remain, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress overwhelms me, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, granting me the strength to persevere, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate years, and it was the northern mountains near the campus that initially captivated me. Certainly, the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, but it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way. There are numerous cafés where many caffeine-fueled study sessions took place. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area immerses you in an old-world charm with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals as much energy and activity as its neighboring urban city. However, this liveliness only spans a few blocks, after which you can retreat once more to the tranquil small-town feel by passing the library. This close proximity of contrasting atmospheres gives the city an enchanting vibe, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-night study session or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the elegant theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it also holds its share of painful memories, as all places inevitably do in life. The ponds, for instance, can be an ideal spot for reflection or for tearful moments at two in the morning during an existential crisis—something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I struggled to navigate the enigma of life. So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its radiant light atop the palm trees, painting the sky in its wake, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they rekindled my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip isn’t typically where you’d expect to find homes. Certainly not desirable ones. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue around the hotels that fill up only during the summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets are several apartment complexes, lined up meticulously like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged side by side. The first set of apartments has been in the news for some less-than-flattering reasons, so let’s not dwell on them—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the adjacent complexes offer a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet cluster of buildings where students trickle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. as they start their day. The gates open slowly to let them in, while drivers nearby express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road extends into another residential street, flanked by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a leisurely spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees drift among the flowers nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the young girls gathered by the playground, chattering about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Next to the park, there’s a sushi restaurant in a strip mall with affordable food that rarely seems crowded. A swimming supply store and a nail salon are nearby, allowing you to prep your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and some hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens frequently hang out, holding their chilled cups heaped with toppings as they perform skateboard tricks and vape, thinking it’s the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of American life—a piece of history in the unchanging, tranquil South.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but a few have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes any sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to encompass the people of this nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors to believe the dream is alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as before, the maintenance of small yards has waned, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, nurturing a future in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but basketball courts are bustling. Although each home looks different, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket named Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family here, while the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy—because, apparently, drugs solve everything, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater showing old films at reduced prices, avoided by the youth who dislike its lack of new releases but appreciated by elders who find it a small price for a night out, sans kids. An expressway runs through my town, though the exit and entrance lie in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the youth supported it, but the elders opposed it, claiming an expressway exit would spoil the town. Their persuasion led the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being constructed, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed, seemingly at random, with commercial zones where a wide array of businesses operate. These businesses include offices, various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of new dining options and shops to explore. While some stores belong to large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods, made lively by nearby attractions. There are a couple of parks nearby, which are popular spots for families with young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse, featuring a significant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are even more people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk in the city, as it is vast, and most prefer not to travel on foot. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and parking can be challenging to find anywhere. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Despite this, there is a variety of housing options, not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of various ages, and honestly, I'm not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the neighborhood who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is all there is!\" I responded, aware that the vast openness would surprise her. She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was just a short five-minute walk from her home—she had never experienced such expansive space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a narrow country road, you will come across a quarry filled with water, and just beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, there is an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. The driveways boast high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that sparkle in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue toward my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing his lawn, singing above the sound of his mower. He is the source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely a wonderful person with an interesting history. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower as he has aged and lost some of his sharpness. Eventually, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese abound, pursued by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water, and an occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals—mostly just chasing them—there was always something to do, often with a neighborhood friend. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they possess a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blooms become skeletal structures of bark. When snow occasionally falls, it transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels crafted by my little sister, along with snowmen. As kids, my sister and I often argued, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We built large igloo-like forts to store our 'ammunition,' using branches like an arsenal. In this little wonderland, we played pretend, at a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Every destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most beautiful locations, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by water, with stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches where you can dip your toes are everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses aren't packed closely together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some remodeled and some retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street. Many homes feature older aluminum siding, and in the surrounding blocks, houses come in every imaginable color. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America—hardworking people making a living, raising or having raised families. On any day, you'll see children playing in the streets and people walking dogs, cycling, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and it’s easy to tell who belongs. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a smile with someone walking their dog from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, without leaves left over from fall. Green grass is neatly mowed, and plants and bushes are trimmed. While the neighborhood isn't strikingly beautiful, it's a place where you'd think it'd be ideal to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though average in appearance, it is outstanding for being a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff’s department and jail. Next to that is the Health Department. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving local residents. Nearby, there are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is adjacent to these fields, allowing you to hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside resembles a typical suburban setting, characterized by uniformity. In my particular neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, a result of the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each home includes a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads, free of potholes, despite the various families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's focus on uniformity is responsible for this setup. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to exercise; the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mostly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for each other. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population, yet it retains a small-town feel with most amenities available. We have one mall that, while not enormous, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where numerous shopping options await. There are high-end grocery stores offering organic products and discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, featuring nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we aren't immediately adjacent to shopping centers, you can easily drive to any major chain store you need.",
            "The first time I learned about my apartment, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment around here costs over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends end up crying themselves to sleep. Life is pricey, but over time, we've mastered the art of frugality. You begin to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes stored away with mothballs. As adults, we notice odors less. You might take up smoking, or perhaps you're just used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market always makes its presence known. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. This scent clings to leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. Despite the traffic outside, they're quiet. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. They say it's a city on the rise, home to one of the largest online empires in e-commerce and delivery, yet still grappling with growth challenges. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own objectives, and few demand anything from you. You can be solitary, silent, and self-reliant, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude on others' lives. You can maintain your protective shell as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like ocean waves. It's an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, our apartment is less of a place filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and lend a hand when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure I clean up after myself, share food with them, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but it's neighbors like mine who make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban outskirts of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is the most economically challenged area. The property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only experienced minor incidents, such as the occasional theft from our porch when items are left out. The town as a whole has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" prevalent in many parts of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, our town offers ample resources to tackle this crisis, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for loved ones of those affected by addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive features. My son's elementary school has an excellent team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's positive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys attending. The active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family faces discrimination for an inability to pay, and school-related costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements have mainly been centralized in the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a concern for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options, both small businesses and larger stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suitable. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Situated on a hill, it is surrounded by buildings of historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill, there's a charming little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this part of town. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains of mid-winter make staying warm difficult. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, helps keep them warmer. They're also within walking and transit distance of the only family center for miles, where they can wash up. What I cherish about my city isn't just the historical beauty—the towering buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills descending to the ocean. What I truly love about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast. Even now, three decades later, stories circulate about federal and DEA agents sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these tales, passing them down to newcomers like me. Although Hilltop is still considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness. They care deeply about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is an echo of the past, tinged with social conditioning's bitterness. Perhaps it's because I can pass as not completely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own—someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born from ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself on being a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, give me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually grew close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Those friends have since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with numerous two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, you can hear children playing outside, but it's generally quiet during the week. I’ve never had any issues with my neighbors; they leave you alone unless you need assistance. I often order packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I have many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories happened there, too, when I got hit in the nose while playing football, but the positive memories far outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who love the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park fills them with excitement, and it brings a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a mile. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for convenience, though fast food spots remain popular, as they are in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores provide everything you might need, with several dry cleaners and both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, alongside a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop perfect for purchasing ingredients or ready-made Indian meals. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few enjoyable and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently got a new name and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are generally friendly, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, since the apartment rents aren't high. There's an elementary school within walking distance, so there are many children around. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so management installed an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and slightly insulting. The surrounding buildings look old but might have updated interiors. A bit further down the street are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which I consider a scam. There's a cheap restaurant five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Opposite that is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the city-funded road improvements last summer added a nice sidewalk and greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some were cut down, leaving stumps, and there are more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, whereas 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings. The trees there likely conceal the buildings' conditions. Most local crime occurs at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but my street also has crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my living situation. It's affordable, and there are many convenient amenities nearby. I particularly appreciate that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged in a way that makes them resemble individual homes. However, they all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most residents are friends, often gathering at the end of an unspecified driveway in the evenings to chat while the local children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This social atmosphere is refreshing in our technology-driven world and feels like a step back in time. The neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and puffy clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard actual sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room barking. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared as the sun came out during a brief rain shower. I dashed inside to grab my camera and took pictures to share on Facebook, which amazed my friends and family, as it did me. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until people returned home after the storm. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents people have here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors vary in size, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and heading to the nearby pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening as a reminder of its presence. I feel fortunate to have found this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share my experiences. Initially, I was quite upset when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was heartbroken, but my parents wanted better opportunities for me and my sister, like an improved living area and a better high school, in a neighborhood perceived as more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, making new friends and some rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value their presence. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyful occasion. I even caught the garter, although I missed out on the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I especially enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's moved on to great things. The neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I now explore more than before, especially when hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We often played video games and lived life fully. Occasionally, I'd visit the park for some nature therapy, which brings me peace. I also practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken wooden sword. Although I haven't played basketball or tennis lately, it's nice to know the courts are there. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable moments here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that might not distinguish itself from others in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact displayed on the town's welcome sign. The area is predominantly farmland, featuring peach trees and cattle. Houses outside the town's center are spaced far apart, mostly two-story buildings with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing the front land to be used for livestock or crops. In the town's center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection where the few local stores are found. You can grab \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's only grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is small and pricey. Many residents prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-loved local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and provides delivery services with two movers. Attached to the furniture store is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There's a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice outside the main town area, both well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston has just one elementary school, and students must go to the next town for middle and high school. Although there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to offer more family-friendly activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide range of restaurants, Johnston remains a pleasant town that can be missed in the blink of an eye.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but despite that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's not much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people living here. Residents often engage in yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars that locals drive. When we notice an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to keep an eye on it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out, and kids play on bikes, as you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from there. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. This means the neighborhood is also accustomed to our comings and goings. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. There's almost always someone mowing the lawn here, with the sound of lawnmowers audible nearly every day from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing plenty of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Since our garage is at the back of our house, we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's similar for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood lies right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to really grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a green lawn, it's clear that person is spending a fortune on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that hasn't changed much, there's been a lot of new development. Honestly, this place is beginning to resemble a city more and more each day, but I suppose that’s a trend happening everywhere. Generally, the people are quite friendly, though like any city, there are both good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I’m surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores around here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you’re looking for upscale shopping, you have to travel a bit further; I rarely see Whole Foods or similar stores. The jobs that seem most common in my city, without relying on official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because the city is still not fully developed, with lots of open spaces available for building. That prospect unnerves me since I like things the way they are now. I left a large city and I'm not eager to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in this field as I install drywall and T-bar. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for numerous reasons, one of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert’s climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about the wildlife inhabiting this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Moreover, Victorville is a great place for families to explore the desert, offering unique experiences. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair, which will enhance your visit with a mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons to complete your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that narrate the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also consider the greater campus area as my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that form my neighborhood. Before diving into the houses, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room typically accommodates 2-4 people, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common buildings have around 2 floors, hosting about 20 people each. Second, there are the actual houses that anyone connected to the school can rent. These usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the standard dorm rooms which house hundreds of students, with two sharing a room, generally speaking. This is the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, reflected in my neighborhood's demographic. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most of the professional staff live in the houses within the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. It’s hard to fully capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood through mere words, so let’s move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers numerous shops and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, alongside the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. The terrain slopes downward, and my home is perched at the top of the steepest hill nearby. Locals nickname it the \"work out hill\" since many joggers choose it for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which is pothole-ridden and somewhat risky for driving. The telephone and power lines in the neighborhood appear worn and patched up. Frequent storms and rainfall cause branches and debris to often damage the lines, leading to repeated repairs that give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are abundant, but residents dislike them because they block the ocean view. Consequently, many homes are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The area is breathtaking at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's mostly cloudy, with the sun often seen through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, and moss thrives on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and it became covered in moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in the vicinity, despite a nearby school. Most residents are older and retired, preferring dogs over children. It's typical to see dogs lounging on lawns or playing in the street. Leaving a door or window open can result in dogs entering your home; I once found one in my living room. Rabbits are plentiful and roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay, as they damage plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in the neighborhood. We also see various birds, from sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks or eagles appear until crows drive them away. There are no stores nearby, but a downhill walk to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be challenging! Public transportation is highly accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a predominantly urban area, so you'll still feel the vibrant atmosphere of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit, as the neighborhood has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. You'll come across at least one Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are favored by locals for their excellent food quality, lower prices, and convenience. In my vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of shopping for groceries. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely inhabited by Asian residents; it's a diverse community with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. While many of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a newly renovated park nearby featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given we're in New York City, the park is naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. In Bensonhurst, you won't find many large corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op or condominium apartment buildings, with most housing being two-family homes. The residents are generally friendly but quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or speeding by, which may wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise caution. Although the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault here years ago, and package theft is a recent issue. Despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, the rule isn't always followed here. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest frustration is the prevalence of dog waste throughout the neighborhood. Be mindful to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is all about, you must first understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes bending the rules—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was more obscure, affordable, and a breeding ground for creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos built for them, Portland retains its quirks. Being weird here doesn't necessarily mean being universally accepting, but it does imply embracing what is typically not accepted. It doesn’t mean the absence of modern conveniences or struggles; like other places, Portland buys most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy the norm, yet Portland is also quite ordinary, with yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird here means not taking things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many around Portland, you’ll find vibrant houses, gardens lining the streets with flowers and produce, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs, often containing something serendipitously fitting for a passerby. They usually hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. This enchanting possibility of discovery defines Portland for me, though I am just one of countless expressions of weird. Some locals would never consider picking clothes out of a sidewalk box; they might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is home to people with diverse passions, who chase their dreams—or dream of doing so, while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, there’s a drug issue, often linked to mental health challenges, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also faces a homelessness crisis, with few solutions in sight. The homeless community is drawn by the city’s relatively better social services, which remain inadequate, as is the case nationwide. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast. In the north, they silently observe the sun's passage at each dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become preoccupied with the busyness of work and life, they remain, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress overwhelms me, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, granting me the strength to persevere, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate years, and it was the northern mountains near the campus that initially captivated me. Certainly, the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, but it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way. There are numerous cafés where many caffeine-fueled study sessions took place. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area immerses you in an old-world charm with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals as much energy and activity as its neighboring urban city. However, this liveliness only spans a few blocks, after which you can retreat once more to the tranquil small-town feel by passing the library. This close proximity of contrasting atmospheres gives the city an enchanting vibe, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-night study session or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the elegant theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it also holds its share of painful memories, as all places inevitably do in life. The ponds, for instance, can be an ideal spot for reflection or for tearful moments at two in the morning during an existential crisis—something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I struggled to navigate the enigma of life. So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its radiant light atop the palm trees, painting the sky in its wake, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they rekindled my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip isn’t typically where you’d expect to find homes. Certainly not desirable ones. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue around the hotels that fill up only during the summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets are several apartment complexes, lined up meticulously like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged side by side. The first set of apartments has been in the news for some less-than-flattering reasons, so let’s not dwell on them—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the adjacent complexes offer a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet cluster of buildings where students trickle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. as they start their day. The gates open slowly to let them in, while drivers nearby express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road extends into another residential street, flanked by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a leisurely spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees drift among the flowers nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the young girls gathered by the playground, chattering about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Next to the park, there’s a sushi restaurant in a strip mall with affordable food that rarely seems crowded. A swimming supply store and a nail salon are nearby, allowing you to prep your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and some hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens frequently hang out, holding their chilled cups heaped with toppings as they perform skateboard tricks and vape, thinking it’s the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of American life—a piece of history in the unchanging, tranquil South.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but a few have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes any sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to encompass the people of this nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors to believe the dream is alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as before, the maintenance of small yards has waned, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, nurturing a future in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but basketball courts are bustling. Although each home looks different, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket named Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family here, while the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy—because, apparently, drugs solve everything, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater showing old films at reduced prices, avoided by the youth who dislike its lack of new releases but appreciated by elders who find it a small price for a night out, sans kids. An expressway runs through my town, though the exit and entrance lie in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the youth supported it, but the elders opposed it, claiming an expressway exit would spoil the town. Their persuasion led the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being constructed, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed, seemingly at random, with commercial zones where a wide array of businesses operate. These businesses include offices, various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of new dining options and shops to explore. While some stores belong to large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods, made lively by nearby attractions. There are a couple of parks nearby, which are popular spots for families with young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse, featuring a significant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are even more people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk in the city, as it is vast, and most prefer not to travel on foot. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and parking can be challenging to find anywhere. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Despite this, there is a variety of housing options, not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of various ages, and honestly, I'm not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the neighborhood who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is all there is!\" I responded, aware that the vast openness would surprise her. She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was just a short five-minute walk from her home—she had never experienced such expansive space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a narrow country road, you will come across a quarry filled with water, and just beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, there is an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. The driveways boast high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that sparkle in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue toward my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing his lawn, singing above the sound of his mower. He is the source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely a wonderful person with an interesting history. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower as he has aged and lost some of his sharpness. Eventually, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese abound, pursued by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water, and an occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals—mostly just chasing them—there was always something to do, often with a neighborhood friend. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they possess a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blooms become skeletal structures of bark. When snow occasionally falls, it transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels crafted by my little sister, along with snowmen. As kids, my sister and I often argued, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We built large igloo-like forts to store our 'ammunition,' using branches like an arsenal. In this little wonderland, we played pretend, at a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small Michigan town where farmland transitions into quaint tourist spots. There aren't any large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To reach any destination, driving is necessary. Nevertheless, I live in one of the world's most picturesque locations, surrounded by water. My town is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, offering places to wade in. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren’t densely packed or identical. They are older, with some being renovated while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements visible from the street. Many houses have older aluminum siding and are painted in a variety of colors. Yards are common, often equipped with trampolines and playsets, and some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have done so. Children are often seen playing in the streets, and it's usual to see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, and it's easy to identify those who belong. You might see someone grilling and wave, or smile at a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-kept, without piles of leaves from fall, and the grass is neatly trimmed. If there are plants and shrubs, they are maintained. The neighborhood may not be visually striking with impressive homes, but it feels like a good place for raising a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. Its average appearance belies its exceptional nature as it offers the safety people desire at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there’s the county sheriff’s department and jail, and the health department is nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving locals and visitors alike. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Next to these is our small town airport, where you can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing. You can stroll to the local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, you can walk downtown from our neighborhood. My children can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a standard, uniform suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, maintained thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, occasionally dotted with small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved concrete roads that are in excellent condition, with no potholes despite the many families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment complex, where each resident uses a key to access their mailbox. Two larger lockers are available for packages. This uniformity is another product of the HOA. My house is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making the neighborhood part rural, part suburban. This provides plenty of space for various amenities, including multiple community pools that residents can access, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is large enough to run around for a good workout. Most residents are retired, creating a safe community where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel, offering most of the amenities one would expect. For instance, there is one mall, not very big but sufficient. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to any significant location, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t right next door, a short drive provides access to any major chain store.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons, which caught me off guard. In this area, most apartments were priced over a thousand dollars a month, yet neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. It might be due to the challenges we face. Some of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Despite the high costs, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored for a long time. Adult life carries fewer scents. You might pick up smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market's aroma is always present. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after it's washed. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. You can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you start at one end. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. Despite the traffic and crowds outside, the stores remain silent, making them a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood the area. It's regarded as a developing city, housing one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own goals and doesn’t demand much from others. You can be solitary and independent, and nobody will bother you. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of care, here, people don't intrude on your life. You can maintain your privacy, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a beach. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, we have more of a community of friends than just a group of strangers in an apartment. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, attend funerals, and help when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail, and it's nice to see them. I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, it’s the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town located just beyond the suburbs of a large city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amiable, often smiling and greeting me as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes nearby, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, my family has only been indirectly affected by crime, such as minor thefts from our porch when we forget to secure items. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, numerous resources are available to address this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those battling addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite his special needs, he has not experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he loves. We have an active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to encourage family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is marginalized due to financial constraints, and the costs for school-related expenses are quite reasonable. The City Council has made several improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most enhancements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heaviest. The east side, where I live, often gets overlooked, which is a source of frustration for residents. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for more than 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and a block down the hill is a trendy little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there's a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete with tall steps embedded in the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents neatly along the sidewalk and steps. It doesn't snow much, but the heavy rains in mid-winter often make it hard to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic beauty—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I truly love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The people remember, passing down these tales from generation to generation, including to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents work hard to maintain it. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past and is shaped by social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born of ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close with a neighbor who lived two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them resides there anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, featuring many two-story homes. On weekends or whenever the weather is warm, I can hear kids playing outside. The area is generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the people here. In this neighborhood, you're left alone unless you seek assistance. I've ordered several packages online and none have been stolen from my porch, which gives me a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is just a minute or two from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other local guys. One of my worst memories is also from there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just mentioning a trip to the park excites them. The park now brings back many nostalgic memories for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, offering a wide range of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now prefer using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast-food places are the most popular, but these are common in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a popular chain in the Midwest. Some stores also reflect the neighborhood's diversity, like an Indian-owned store for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it’s close to the college I attend. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to visit. One of the bars recently changed its name and it’s a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks is decent. The community is mostly friendly, comprised of college students and lower-income residents, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children in the area because there's an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. Although I don't know my neighbors and don't wish to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener outside their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings around me generally look old but might have renovated interiors. A bit further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they are poorly constructed yet have high rent, which feels like a scam due to their proximity to campus. There’s a very cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, which is reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the road was improved last summer thanks to city funding, adding a big sidewalk and grassy areas, making it a bit nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but the street behind, 43rd Street, isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are deteriorating, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to obscure the building's appearance. Most of the crime occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but even the apartments across from me have their share of crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It’s affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university’s proximity and the two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. These homes are spaced in such a way that they resemble standalone houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friends, and in the evenings, we gather at random driveways to chat while the children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing contrast to our modern, technology-driven world, reminiscent of a bygone era. We are surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, stayed in the living room, uneasy and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the abrupt temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm. Then, life returned to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but despite the identical exteriors, the interiors vary, with some being quite small, which I find puzzling. I enjoy walking in the large field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite upset moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved ones. However, my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a neighborhood with better housing and schools, described as \"not ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends, and even a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, both living next door. They’ve been wonderful and almost feel like family, for which I’m grateful. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family (he remarried), which was a delightful event. I aspire to have a similar celebration one day, to provide a royal life for my future wife. At the wedding, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced all night, especially enjoying the company of Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is quite confusing but with GPS, I explore more, mostly with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games together and enjoy life. Sometimes, I’d go to the park to relax in nature, which brings me peace. I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken sword for fun. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast despite the tough training. Reflecting on my time in this neighborhood, I’ve had many enjoyable experiences and look forward to more great memories.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It might blend in with other towns in South Carolina, but it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly refers to itself as the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The area is mainly farmland, filled with peach trees and cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are usually set back from the road to allow the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are found. For \"fast food,\" there are three options: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to operate here but has recently closed. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, so many locals prefer traveling to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger grocery runs. Dollar General is the most frequented store, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with customers from opening to closing. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a well-known local woman and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Connected to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and after fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Currently, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more family outings and attract potential residents. Though options for entertainment like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and playgrounds are lacking, it's a pleasant town that one might easily pass by without noticing due to its small size.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, but aside from that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the residents. People generally occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, allowing us to observe the comings and goings of the neighborhood and become acquainted with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we tend to notice it. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids often ride their bikes, which is pretty typical around here. Since we work from home, my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and I are frequently at home. Consequently, the neighbors are also accustomed to seeing us around. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, with the sound of lawnmowers almost daily from March until about October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was once a wooded area, providing a lot of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a pleasant signal of fall's arrival. Recently, we've experienced mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's the same for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt everywhere. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown, and when you spot a lawn, you realize that person is likely spending a lot on maintenance. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were few and far between. Nowadays, it's still quite similar, except there are many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to look more like a city every day, but I suppose many areas are evolving in the same way. Most of the people here are very friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly older folks, which makes it a nicer area. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel since stores like Whole Foods are scarce. The most common jobs, as far as I can tell without official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because there's still a lot of undeveloped land here, with plenty of room to build. That worries me a bit because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field; I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, especially the stark beauty of the desert. The high desert's climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these animals to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun in true Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my perspective is somewhat distinct. Unlike most respondents who are likely homeowners with separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory serving as my community. I also consider the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. There are three types of housing nearby: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common building type generally has 2 floors, housing around 20 people per building. Second, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are few since they are less efficient. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms house hundreds of students, with usually two people sharing a room, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while newer students stay in dormitory housing, and older students opt for apartment-style living. It's hard to do justice to the people here with words alone, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Hence, everything needed is available within my neighborhood! Moreover, the park serves as a playground for the diverse populace, kept clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downward, with my house perched atop the steepest hill locally known as the \"work out hill\" due to the joggers who tackle it during their exercise routines. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk directly on the road, which is rough and sometimes feels risky to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the area appear worn and patched. Frequent rain and storms knock down branches and debris onto the power lines, resulting in frequent repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but locals dislike them because they block ocean views. Consequently, many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The sunset is stunning when the water seems illuminated beneath an orange sky, although clouds usually obscure the sun, leaving most days gray and damp. Moss thrives everywhere, covering roofs, cars, and railings. Once, when I left my car outside for a month, it turned green with moss, and cleaning it took three hours. Children are few despite a nearby school; the neighborhood mostly consists of older, often retired residents who prefer dogs over kids. It's typical to see dogs playing on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and they sometimes sneak into open homes. I once had to escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers locally. The area hosts various birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles, which the local crows usually chase away. There are no nearby stores, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a beach, but the rocks are fun to toss into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still experience the typical New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, particularly supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are very popular with locals, offering excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are conveniently located. Near my location, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, enhancing grocery shopping convenience. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most major and popular local businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't have many large corporate buildings, mostly offering co-op living or condominium apartments, with two-family houses being predominant. The residents are generally friendly but can be quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or revving engines that can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault in the past, although it was years ago. A recent issue has been package theft, which is common here. Despite New York City's fines for not cleaning up after pets, many here disregard the rules. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your route to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is dog waste scattered around the neighborhood. Be cautious and watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial town motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the '90s and early 2000s, a less famous and costly city fostering creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does embrace what is usually unaccepted. It doesn't mean lacking modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of America, we buy much of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps weirdness means we simply don't take it all too seriously. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, contain items someone no longer wants, often holding a perfect treasure for a passerby. They frequently have clothes and books but can contain anything. The enchanting possibility of finding something special in a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland for me, though I'm just one of many varieties of weirdness here. Some residents would never consider selecting their attire from a box on the sidewalk. These folks might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is filled with people passionate about diverse interests. Here, people chase dreams or dream of chasing them while spending too much time at bars. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. At its core, like many drug problems, it ties back to mental health, with the persistent rain and gloomy clouds contributing factors. Portland also faces homelessness, a challenge without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by the city's relatively superior social services, though still inadequate like elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we aren't weird at all.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, witnessing the sun's rise and fall every day from the north. Even when I become preoccupied with work and life and forget about them, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they demand my attention, offering solace and strength to help me carry on, day by day. When I began my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to these northern mountains near the campus. While the university boasts its own scenic beauty with its architecture, ponds, and trees, it is the mountains that truly captivate me. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés where I've spent countless hours studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown reveals a historic atmosphere with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices, giving the town a lively energy akin to its neighboring city. However, this urban vibe is fleeting, as one can retreat to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments creates a unique allure, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories, whether it's strolling through a park after an all-nighter with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like everywhere, it holds difficult memories too. The ponds, in particular, serve as places for reflection and midnight soul-searching during existential crises, which I've experienced more than once. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects, each living with purpose, I often ponder my own role in life. Walking past the pond, park, and suburban houses, I eventually reach a main street, where the sun illuminates the palm trees and paints the sky. Looking at the sunrise, I realize I'm heading north. There, as always, stand the mountains, rising above the hazy sky more prominently than any building, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—being a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, it doesn’t seem like a typical place to find homes. Not the kind most people would choose, anyway. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue beyond the hotels, mostly filled during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. In this neighborhood, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes, arranged like meticulously separated Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you encounter has been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we’ll skip over it—appearances can be misleading. However, the apartments adjacent to it, and the next two complexes, belong to a different world unknown to most locals. Opposite these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students, coffee in hand, arrive at 7 a.m., still sleepy. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while drivers shake their fists out of frustration at the traffic they cause on busier days. The road intersects another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along a path, frowning at skateboarding teens and nodding politely to girls chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Next to the park in a strip mall, there's a sushi restaurant with affordable prices, though rarely crowded—a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. It's possible to prepare your pool for summer while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens frequent with cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it’s cool. This neighborhood embodies Americana—a glimpse of history in the sleepy South, where change is rare, and time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood holds a unique charm. Most homes are single-family residences, but a few have been divided into two connected units. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it evokes a bygone era when suburban living epitomized the American dream—a dream that once embraced the nation but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, neighborhoods like mine endure, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream persists, even if we cling to it less confidently. People aren't as hopeful as before, and the little yards aren't as well-kept, but you still find a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if their world is the only one that exists. The nearly 90-year-old public school still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home looks different but shares a similar feel. A large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family—possibly the only Arab family in the area—serves the community, which is predominantly African American. The wide streets often host kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the decline in popularity of karate-themed movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, as if medication is the solution to everything, or so they say. A small movie theater shows classic films at a reduced rate, drawing older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out, minus the kids. An expressway runs through town, though the entry and exit are in the neighboring town. There was an attempt to secure an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed it would spoil the town's character. In the end, the elders convinced the city council to decline the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, where various businesses operate. These businesses include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. While some stores are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and peaceful, if not for the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks nearby that are popular for families with young children. Regarding the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a compact area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, although they often form their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can result in a lengthy drive. Driving just 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. In my city, most people don’t walk to their destinations. Despite some places being nearby, the city is large, and walking isn't a common choice. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking can be challenging almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been significant development in recent years, with large apartment buildings popping up. The city is a popular place to live, but many residents worry about more people moving in and adding more cars to the roads. There are many types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives in or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas feature houses of various sizes and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even in my immediate neighborhood, so there is a variety of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors well. It’s not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast, open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home and had never experienced so much open space. As she marveled at the abundance of cornfields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down the two-lane country road, you'll come upon a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the modest development where I live. Most houses are made of brick and stucco, each boasting at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, shimmering under the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we continue toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum with song. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he's genuine, with an intriguing past. Though he's grown older and lost some sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese scatter as our Terrier chases them. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the gentle stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them. There was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. Winters in my small town can be harsh but breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange blooms become skeletal. When it snows, a winter wonderland emerges overnight. The backyard is dotted with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In this winter wonderland, we played make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree young kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small Michigan town where farmland transitions into quaint tourist spots. There aren't any large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To reach any destination, driving is necessary. Nevertheless, I live in one of the world's most picturesque locations, surrounded by water. My town is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, offering places to wade in. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren’t densely packed or identical. They are older, with some being renovated while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements visible from the street. Many houses have older aluminum siding and are painted in a variety of colors. Yards are common, often equipped with trampolines and playsets, and some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have done so. Children are often seen playing in the streets, and it's usual to see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, and it's easy to identify those who belong. You might see someone grilling and wave, or smile at a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-kept, without piles of leaves from fall, and the grass is neatly trimmed. If there are plants and shrubs, they are maintained. The neighborhood may not be visually striking with impressive homes, but it feels like a good place for raising a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. Its average appearance belies its exceptional nature as it offers the safety people desire at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there’s the county sheriff’s department and jail, and the health department is nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving locals and visitors alike. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Next to these is our small town airport, where you can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing. You can stroll to the local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, you can walk downtown from our neighborhood. My children can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a standard, uniform suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, maintained thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, occasionally dotted with small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved concrete roads that are in excellent condition, with no potholes despite the many families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment complex, where each resident uses a key to access their mailbox. Two larger lockers are available for packages. This uniformity is another product of the HOA. My house is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making the neighborhood part rural, part suburban. This provides plenty of space for various amenities, including multiple community pools that residents can access, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is large enough to run around for a good workout. Most residents are retired, creating a safe community where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel, offering most of the amenities one would expect. For instance, there is one mall, not very big but sufficient. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to any significant location, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t right next door, a short drive provides access to any major chain store.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons, which caught me off guard. In this area, most apartments were priced over a thousand dollars a month, yet neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. It might be due to the challenges we face. Some of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Despite the high costs, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored for a long time. Adult life carries fewer scents. You might pick up smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market's aroma is always present. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after it's washed. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. You can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you start at one end. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. Despite the traffic and crowds outside, the stores remain silent, making them a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood the area. It's regarded as a developing city, housing one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own goals and doesn’t demand much from others. You can be solitary and independent, and nobody will bother you. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of care, here, people don't intrude on your life. You can maintain your privacy, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a beach. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, we have more of a community of friends than just a group of strangers in an apartment. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, attend funerals, and help when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail, and it's nice to see them. I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, it’s the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town located just beyond the suburbs of a large city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amiable, often smiling and greeting me as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes nearby, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, my family has only been indirectly affected by crime, such as minor thefts from our porch when we forget to secure items. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, numerous resources are available to address this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those battling addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite his special needs, he has not experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he loves. We have an active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to encourage family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is marginalized due to financial constraints, and the costs for school-related expenses are quite reasonable. The City Council has made several improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most enhancements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heaviest. The east side, where I live, often gets overlooked, which is a source of frustration for residents. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for more than 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and a block down the hill is a trendy little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there's a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete with tall steps embedded in the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents neatly along the sidewalk and steps. It doesn't snow much, but the heavy rains in mid-winter often make it hard to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic beauty—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I truly love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The people remember, passing down these tales from generation to generation, including to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents work hard to maintain it. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past and is shaped by social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born of ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close with a neighbor who lived two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them resides there anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, featuring many two-story homes. On weekends or whenever the weather is warm, I can hear kids playing outside. The area is generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the people here. In this neighborhood, you're left alone unless you seek assistance. I've ordered several packages online and none have been stolen from my porch, which gives me a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is just a minute or two from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other local guys. One of my worst memories is also from there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just mentioning a trip to the park excites them. The park now brings back many nostalgic memories for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, offering a wide range of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now prefer using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast-food places are the most popular, but these are common in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a popular chain in the Midwest. Some stores also reflect the neighborhood's diversity, like an Indian-owned store for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it’s close to the college I attend. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to visit. One of the bars recently changed its name and it’s a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks is decent. The community is mostly friendly, comprised of college students and lower-income residents, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children in the area because there's an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. Although I don't know my neighbors and don't wish to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener outside their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings around me generally look old but might have renovated interiors. A bit further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they are poorly constructed yet have high rent, which feels like a scam due to their proximity to campus. There’s a very cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, which is reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the road was improved last summer thanks to city funding, adding a big sidewalk and grassy areas, making it a bit nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but the street behind, 43rd Street, isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are deteriorating, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to obscure the building's appearance. Most of the crime occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but even the apartments across from me have their share of crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It’s affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university’s proximity and the two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. These homes are spaced in such a way that they resemble standalone houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friends, and in the evenings, we gather at random driveways to chat while the children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing contrast to our modern, technology-driven world, reminiscent of a bygone era. We are surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, stayed in the living room, uneasy and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the abrupt temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm. Then, life returned to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but despite the identical exteriors, the interiors vary, with some being quite small, which I find puzzling. I enjoy walking in the large field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite upset moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved ones. However, my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a neighborhood with better housing and schools, described as \"not ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends, and even a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, both living next door. They’ve been wonderful and almost feel like family, for which I’m grateful. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family (he remarried), which was a delightful event. I aspire to have a similar celebration one day, to provide a royal life for my future wife. At the wedding, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced all night, especially enjoying the company of Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is quite confusing but with GPS, I explore more, mostly with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games together and enjoy life. Sometimes, I’d go to the park to relax in nature, which brings me peace. I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken sword for fun. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast despite the tough training. Reflecting on my time in this neighborhood, I’ve had many enjoyable experiences and look forward to more great memories.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It might blend in with other towns in South Carolina, but it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly refers to itself as the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The area is mainly farmland, filled with peach trees and cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are usually set back from the road to allow the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are found. For \"fast food,\" there are three options: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to operate here but has recently closed. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, so many locals prefer traveling to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger grocery runs. Dollar General is the most frequented store, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with customers from opening to closing. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a well-known local woman and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Connected to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and after fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Currently, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more family outings and attract potential residents. Though options for entertainment like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and playgrounds are lacking, it's a pleasant town that one might easily pass by without noticing due to its small size.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, but aside from that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the residents. People generally occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, allowing us to observe the comings and goings of the neighborhood and become acquainted with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we tend to notice it. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids often ride their bikes, which is pretty typical around here. Since we work from home, my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and I are frequently at home. Consequently, the neighbors are also accustomed to seeing us around. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, with the sound of lawnmowers almost daily from March until about October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was once a wooded area, providing a lot of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a pleasant signal of fall's arrival. Recently, we've experienced mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's the same for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt everywhere. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown, and when you spot a lawn, you realize that person is likely spending a lot on maintenance. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were few and far between. Nowadays, it's still quite similar, except there are many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to look more like a city every day, but I suppose many areas are evolving in the same way. Most of the people here are very friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly older folks, which makes it a nicer area. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel since stores like Whole Foods are scarce. The most common jobs, as far as I can tell without official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because there's still a lot of undeveloped land here, with plenty of room to build. That worries me a bit because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field; I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, especially the stark beauty of the desert. The high desert's climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these animals to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun in true Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my perspective is somewhat distinct. Unlike most respondents who are likely homeowners with separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory serving as my community. I also consider the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. There are three types of housing nearby: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common building type generally has 2 floors, housing around 20 people per building. Second, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are few since they are less efficient. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms house hundreds of students, with usually two people sharing a room, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while newer students stay in dormitory housing, and older students opt for apartment-style living. It's hard to do justice to the people here with words alone, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Hence, everything needed is available within my neighborhood! Moreover, the park serves as a playground for the diverse populace, kept clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downward, with my house perched atop the steepest hill locally known as the \"work out hill\" due to the joggers who tackle it during their exercise routines. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk directly on the road, which is rough and sometimes feels risky to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the area appear worn and patched. Frequent rain and storms knock down branches and debris onto the power lines, resulting in frequent repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but locals dislike them because they block ocean views. Consequently, many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The sunset is stunning when the water seems illuminated beneath an orange sky, although clouds usually obscure the sun, leaving most days gray and damp. Moss thrives everywhere, covering roofs, cars, and railings. Once, when I left my car outside for a month, it turned green with moss, and cleaning it took three hours. Children are few despite a nearby school; the neighborhood mostly consists of older, often retired residents who prefer dogs over kids. It's typical to see dogs playing on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and they sometimes sneak into open homes. I once had to escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers locally. The area hosts various birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles, which the local crows usually chase away. There are no nearby stores, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a beach, but the rocks are fun to toss into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still experience the typical New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, particularly supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are very popular with locals, offering excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are conveniently located. Near my location, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, enhancing grocery shopping convenience. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most major and popular local businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't have many large corporate buildings, mostly offering co-op living or condominium apartments, with two-family houses being predominant. The residents are generally friendly but can be quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or revving engines that can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault in the past, although it was years ago. A recent issue has been package theft, which is common here. Despite New York City's fines for not cleaning up after pets, many here disregard the rules. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your route to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is dog waste scattered around the neighborhood. Be cautious and watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial town motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the '90s and early 2000s, a less famous and costly city fostering creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does embrace what is usually unaccepted. It doesn't mean lacking modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of America, we buy much of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps weirdness means we simply don't take it all too seriously. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, contain items someone no longer wants, often holding a perfect treasure for a passerby. They frequently have clothes and books but can contain anything. The enchanting possibility of finding something special in a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland for me, though I'm just one of many varieties of weirdness here. Some residents would never consider selecting their attire from a box on the sidewalk. These folks might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is filled with people passionate about diverse interests. Here, people chase dreams or dream of chasing them while spending too much time at bars. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. At its core, like many drug problems, it ties back to mental health, with the persistent rain and gloomy clouds contributing factors. Portland also faces homelessness, a challenge without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by the city's relatively superior social services, though still inadequate like elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we aren't weird at all.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, witnessing the sun's rise and fall every day from the north. Even when I become preoccupied with work and life and forget about them, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they demand my attention, offering solace and strength to help me carry on, day by day. When I began my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to these northern mountains near the campus. While the university boasts its own scenic beauty with its architecture, ponds, and trees, it is the mountains that truly captivate me. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés where I've spent countless hours studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown reveals a historic atmosphere with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices, giving the town a lively energy akin to its neighboring city. However, this urban vibe is fleeting, as one can retreat to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments creates a unique allure, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories, whether it's strolling through a park after an all-nighter with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like everywhere, it holds difficult memories too. The ponds, in particular, serve as places for reflection and midnight soul-searching during existential crises, which I've experienced more than once. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects, each living with purpose, I often ponder my own role in life. Walking past the pond, park, and suburban houses, I eventually reach a main street, where the sun illuminates the palm trees and paints the sky. Looking at the sunrise, I realize I'm heading north. There, as always, stand the mountains, rising above the hazy sky more prominently than any building, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—being a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, it doesn’t seem like a typical place to find homes. Not the kind most people would choose, anyway. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue beyond the hotels, mostly filled during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. In this neighborhood, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes, arranged like meticulously separated Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you encounter has been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we’ll skip over it—appearances can be misleading. However, the apartments adjacent to it, and the next two complexes, belong to a different world unknown to most locals. Opposite these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students, coffee in hand, arrive at 7 a.m., still sleepy. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while drivers shake their fists out of frustration at the traffic they cause on busier days. The road intersects another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along a path, frowning at skateboarding teens and nodding politely to girls chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Next to the park in a strip mall, there's a sushi restaurant with affordable prices, though rarely crowded—a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. It's possible to prepare your pool for summer while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens frequent with cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it’s cool. This neighborhood embodies Americana—a glimpse of history in the sleepy South, where change is rare, and time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood holds a unique charm. Most homes are single-family residences, but a few have been divided into two connected units. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it evokes a bygone era when suburban living epitomized the American dream—a dream that once embraced the nation but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, neighborhoods like mine endure, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream persists, even if we cling to it less confidently. People aren't as hopeful as before, and the little yards aren't as well-kept, but you still find a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if their world is the only one that exists. The nearly 90-year-old public school still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home looks different but shares a similar feel. A large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family—possibly the only Arab family in the area—serves the community, which is predominantly African American. The wide streets often host kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the decline in popularity of karate-themed movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, as if medication is the solution to everything, or so they say. A small movie theater shows classic films at a reduced rate, drawing older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out, minus the kids. An expressway runs through town, though the entry and exit are in the neighboring town. There was an attempt to secure an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed it would spoil the town's character. In the end, the elders convinced the city council to decline the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, where various businesses operate. These businesses include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. While some stores are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and peaceful, if not for the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks nearby that are popular for families with young children. Regarding the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a compact area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, although they often form their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can result in a lengthy drive. Driving just 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. In my city, most people don’t walk to their destinations. Despite some places being nearby, the city is large, and walking isn't a common choice. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking can be challenging almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been significant development in recent years, with large apartment buildings popping up. The city is a popular place to live, but many residents worry about more people moving in and adding more cars to the roads. There are many types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives in or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas feature houses of various sizes and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even in my immediate neighborhood, so there is a variety of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors well. It’s not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast, open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home and had never experienced so much open space. As she marveled at the abundance of cornfields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down the two-lane country road, you'll come upon a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the modest development where I live. Most houses are made of brick and stucco, each boasting at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, shimmering under the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we continue toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum with song. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he's genuine, with an intriguing past. Though he's grown older and lost some sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese scatter as our Terrier chases them. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the gentle stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them. There was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. Winters in my small town can be harsh but breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange blooms become skeletal. When it snows, a winter wonderland emerges overnight. The backyard is dotted with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In this winter wonderland, we played make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree young kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small Michigan town where farmland transitions into quaint tourist spots. There aren't any large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To reach any destination, driving is necessary. Nevertheless, I live in one of the world's most picturesque locations, surrounded by water. My town is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, offering places to wade in. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren’t densely packed or identical. They are older, with some being renovated while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements visible from the street. Many houses have older aluminum siding and are painted in a variety of colors. Yards are common, often equipped with trampolines and playsets, and some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have done so. Children are often seen playing in the streets, and it's usual to see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, and it's easy to identify those who belong. You might see someone grilling and wave, or smile at a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-kept, without piles of leaves from fall, and the grass is neatly trimmed. If there are plants and shrubs, they are maintained. The neighborhood may not be visually striking with impressive homes, but it feels like a good place for raising a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. Its average appearance belies its exceptional nature as it offers the safety people desire at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there’s the county sheriff’s department and jail, and the health department is nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving locals and visitors alike. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Next to these is our small town airport, where you can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing. You can stroll to the local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, you can walk downtown from our neighborhood. My children can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a standard, uniform suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, maintained thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, occasionally dotted with small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved concrete roads that are in excellent condition, with no potholes despite the many families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment complex, where each resident uses a key to access their mailbox. Two larger lockers are available for packages. This uniformity is another product of the HOA. My house is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making the neighborhood part rural, part suburban. This provides plenty of space for various amenities, including multiple community pools that residents can access, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is large enough to run around for a good workout. Most residents are retired, creating a safe community where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel, offering most of the amenities one would expect. For instance, there is one mall, not very big but sufficient. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to any significant location, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t right next door, a short drive provides access to any major chain store.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons, which caught me off guard. In this area, most apartments were priced over a thousand dollars a month, yet neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. It might be due to the challenges we face. Some of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Despite the high costs, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored for a long time. Adult life carries fewer scents. You might pick up smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market's aroma is always present. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after it's washed. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. You can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you start at one end. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. Despite the traffic and crowds outside, the stores remain silent, making them a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood the area. It's regarded as a developing city, housing one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own goals and doesn’t demand much from others. You can be solitary and independent, and nobody will bother you. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of care, here, people don't intrude on your life. You can maintain your privacy, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a beach. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, we have more of a community of friends than just a group of strangers in an apartment. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, attend funerals, and help when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail, and it's nice to see them. I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, it’s the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town located just beyond the suburbs of a large city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amiable, often smiling and greeting me as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes nearby, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, my family has only been indirectly affected by crime, such as minor thefts from our porch when we forget to secure items. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, numerous resources are available to address this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those battling addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite his special needs, he has not experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he loves. We have an active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to encourage family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is marginalized due to financial constraints, and the costs for school-related expenses are quite reasonable. The City Council has made several improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most enhancements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heaviest. The east side, where I live, often gets overlooked, which is a source of frustration for residents. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for more than 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and a block down the hill is a trendy little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there's a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete with tall steps embedded in the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents neatly along the sidewalk and steps. It doesn't snow much, but the heavy rains in mid-winter often make it hard to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic beauty—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I truly love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The people remember, passing down these tales from generation to generation, including to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents work hard to maintain it. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past and is shaped by social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born of ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close with a neighbor who lived two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them resides there anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, featuring many two-story homes. On weekends or whenever the weather is warm, I can hear kids playing outside. The area is generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the people here. In this neighborhood, you're left alone unless you seek assistance. I've ordered several packages online and none have been stolen from my porch, which gives me a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is just a minute or two from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other local guys. One of my worst memories is also from there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just mentioning a trip to the park excites them. The park now brings back many nostalgic memories for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, offering a wide range of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now prefer using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast-food places are the most popular, but these are common in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a popular chain in the Midwest. Some stores also reflect the neighborhood's diversity, like an Indian-owned store for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it’s close to the college I attend. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to visit. One of the bars recently changed its name and it’s a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks is decent. The community is mostly friendly, comprised of college students and lower-income residents, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children in the area because there's an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. Although I don't know my neighbors and don't wish to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener outside their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings around me generally look old but might have renovated interiors. A bit further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they are poorly constructed yet have high rent, which feels like a scam due to their proximity to campus. There’s a very cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, which is reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the road was improved last summer thanks to city funding, adding a big sidewalk and grassy areas, making it a bit nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but the street behind, 43rd Street, isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are deteriorating, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to obscure the building's appearance. Most of the crime occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but even the apartments across from me have their share of crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It’s affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university’s proximity and the two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. These homes are spaced in such a way that they resemble standalone houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friends, and in the evenings, we gather at random driveways to chat while the children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing contrast to our modern, technology-driven world, reminiscent of a bygone era. We are surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, stayed in the living room, uneasy and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the abrupt temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm. Then, life returned to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but despite the identical exteriors, the interiors vary, with some being quite small, which I find puzzling. I enjoy walking in the large field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite upset moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved ones. However, my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a neighborhood with better housing and schools, described as \"not ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends, and even a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, both living next door. They’ve been wonderful and almost feel like family, for which I’m grateful. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family (he remarried), which was a delightful event. I aspire to have a similar celebration one day, to provide a royal life for my future wife. At the wedding, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced all night, especially enjoying the company of Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is quite confusing but with GPS, I explore more, mostly with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games together and enjoy life. Sometimes, I’d go to the park to relax in nature, which brings me peace. I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken sword for fun. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast despite the tough training. Reflecting on my time in this neighborhood, I’ve had many enjoyable experiences and look forward to more great memories.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It might blend in with other towns in South Carolina, but it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly refers to itself as the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The area is mainly farmland, filled with peach trees and cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are usually set back from the road to allow the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are found. For \"fast food,\" there are three options: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to operate here but has recently closed. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, so many locals prefer traveling to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger grocery runs. Dollar General is the most frequented store, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with customers from opening to closing. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a well-known local woman and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Connected to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and after fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Currently, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more family outings and attract potential residents. Though options for entertainment like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and playgrounds are lacking, it's a pleasant town that one might easily pass by without noticing due to its small size.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, but aside from that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the residents. People generally occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, allowing us to observe the comings and goings of the neighborhood and become acquainted with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we tend to notice it. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids often ride their bikes, which is pretty typical around here. Since we work from home, my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and I are frequently at home. Consequently, the neighbors are also accustomed to seeing us around. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, with the sound of lawnmowers almost daily from March until about October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was once a wooded area, providing a lot of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a pleasant signal of fall's arrival. Recently, we've experienced mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's the same for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt everywhere. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown, and when you spot a lawn, you realize that person is likely spending a lot on maintenance. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were few and far between. Nowadays, it's still quite similar, except there are many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to look more like a city every day, but I suppose many areas are evolving in the same way. Most of the people here are very friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly older folks, which makes it a nicer area. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel since stores like Whole Foods are scarce. The most common jobs, as far as I can tell without official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because there's still a lot of undeveloped land here, with plenty of room to build. That worries me a bit because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field; I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, especially the stark beauty of the desert. The high desert's climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these animals to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun in true Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my perspective is somewhat distinct. Unlike most respondents who are likely homeowners with separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory serving as my community. I also consider the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. There are three types of housing nearby: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common building type generally has 2 floors, housing around 20 people per building. Second, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are few since they are less efficient. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms house hundreds of students, with usually two people sharing a room, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while newer students stay in dormitory housing, and older students opt for apartment-style living. It's hard to do justice to the people here with words alone, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Hence, everything needed is available within my neighborhood! Moreover, the park serves as a playground for the diverse populace, kept clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downward, with my house perched atop the steepest hill locally known as the \"work out hill\" due to the joggers who tackle it during their exercise routines. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk directly on the road, which is rough and sometimes feels risky to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the area appear worn and patched. Frequent rain and storms knock down branches and debris onto the power lines, resulting in frequent repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but locals dislike them because they block ocean views. Consequently, many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The sunset is stunning when the water seems illuminated beneath an orange sky, although clouds usually obscure the sun, leaving most days gray and damp. Moss thrives everywhere, covering roofs, cars, and railings. Once, when I left my car outside for a month, it turned green with moss, and cleaning it took three hours. Children are few despite a nearby school; the neighborhood mostly consists of older, often retired residents who prefer dogs over kids. It's typical to see dogs playing on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and they sometimes sneak into open homes. I once had to escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers locally. The area hosts various birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles, which the local crows usually chase away. There are no nearby stores, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a beach, but the rocks are fun to toss into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still experience the typical New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, particularly supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are very popular with locals, offering excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are conveniently located. Near my location, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, enhancing grocery shopping convenience. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most major and popular local businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't have many large corporate buildings, mostly offering co-op living or condominium apartments, with two-family houses being predominant. The residents are generally friendly but can be quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or revving engines that can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault in the past, although it was years ago. A recent issue has been package theft, which is common here. Despite New York City's fines for not cleaning up after pets, many here disregard the rules. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your route to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is dog waste scattered around the neighborhood. Be cautious and watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial town motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the '90s and early 2000s, a less famous and costly city fostering creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does embrace what is usually unaccepted. It doesn't mean lacking modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of America, we buy much of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps weirdness means we simply don't take it all too seriously. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, contain items someone no longer wants, often holding a perfect treasure for a passerby. They frequently have clothes and books but can contain anything. The enchanting possibility of finding something special in a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland for me, though I'm just one of many varieties of weirdness here. Some residents would never consider selecting their attire from a box on the sidewalk. These folks might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is filled with people passionate about diverse interests. Here, people chase dreams or dream of chasing them while spending too much time at bars. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. At its core, like many drug problems, it ties back to mental health, with the persistent rain and gloomy clouds contributing factors. Portland also faces homelessness, a challenge without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by the city's relatively superior social services, though still inadequate like elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we aren't weird at all.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, witnessing the sun's rise and fall every day from the north. Even when I become preoccupied with work and life and forget about them, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they demand my attention, offering solace and strength to help me carry on, day by day. When I began my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to these northern mountains near the campus. While the university boasts its own scenic beauty with its architecture, ponds, and trees, it is the mountains that truly captivate me. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés where I've spent countless hours studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown reveals a historic atmosphere with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices, giving the town a lively energy akin to its neighboring city. However, this urban vibe is fleeting, as one can retreat to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments creates a unique allure, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories, whether it's strolling through a park after an all-nighter with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like everywhere, it holds difficult memories too. The ponds, in particular, serve as places for reflection and midnight soul-searching during existential crises, which I've experienced more than once. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects, each living with purpose, I often ponder my own role in life. Walking past the pond, park, and suburban houses, I eventually reach a main street, where the sun illuminates the palm trees and paints the sky. Looking at the sunrise, I realize I'm heading north. There, as always, stand the mountains, rising above the hazy sky more prominently than any building, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—being a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, it doesn’t seem like a typical place to find homes. Not the kind most people would choose, anyway. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue beyond the hotels, mostly filled during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. In this neighborhood, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes, arranged like meticulously separated Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you encounter has been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we’ll skip over it—appearances can be misleading. However, the apartments adjacent to it, and the next two complexes, belong to a different world unknown to most locals. Opposite these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students, coffee in hand, arrive at 7 a.m., still sleepy. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while drivers shake their fists out of frustration at the traffic they cause on busier days. The road intersects another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along a path, frowning at skateboarding teens and nodding politely to girls chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Next to the park in a strip mall, there's a sushi restaurant with affordable prices, though rarely crowded—a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. It's possible to prepare your pool for summer while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens frequent with cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it’s cool. This neighborhood embodies Americana—a glimpse of history in the sleepy South, where change is rare, and time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood holds a unique charm. Most homes are single-family residences, but a few have been divided into two connected units. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it evokes a bygone era when suburban living epitomized the American dream—a dream that once embraced the nation but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, neighborhoods like mine endure, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream persists, even if we cling to it less confidently. People aren't as hopeful as before, and the little yards aren't as well-kept, but you still find a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if their world is the only one that exists. The nearly 90-year-old public school still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home looks different but shares a similar feel. A large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family—possibly the only Arab family in the area—serves the community, which is predominantly African American. The wide streets often host kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the decline in popularity of karate-themed movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, as if medication is the solution to everything, or so they say. A small movie theater shows classic films at a reduced rate, drawing older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out, minus the kids. An expressway runs through town, though the entry and exit are in the neighboring town. There was an attempt to secure an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed it would spoil the town's character. In the end, the elders convinced the city council to decline the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, where various businesses operate. These businesses include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. While some stores are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and peaceful, if not for the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks nearby that are popular for families with young children. Regarding the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a compact area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, although they often form their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can result in a lengthy drive. Driving just 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. In my city, most people don’t walk to their destinations. Despite some places being nearby, the city is large, and walking isn't a common choice. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking can be challenging almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been significant development in recent years, with large apartment buildings popping up. The city is a popular place to live, but many residents worry about more people moving in and adding more cars to the roads. There are many types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives in or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas feature houses of various sizes and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even in my immediate neighborhood, so there is a variety of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors well. It’s not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast, open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home and had never experienced so much open space. As she marveled at the abundance of cornfields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down the two-lane country road, you'll come upon a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the modest development where I live. Most houses are made of brick and stucco, each boasting at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, shimmering under the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we continue toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum with song. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he's genuine, with an intriguing past. Though he's grown older and lost some sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese scatter as our Terrier chases them. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the gentle stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them. There was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. Winters in my small town can be harsh but breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange blooms become skeletal. When it snows, a winter wonderland emerges overnight. The backyard is dotted with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In this winter wonderland, we played make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree young kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart or Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to reach any destination. Despite this, I am fortunate to live in one of the most stunning areas of the world, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are readily accessible for a quick dip almost everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren't crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some of which have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many homes have full basements visible from the street, and several feature older aluminum siding. The neighborhood boasts houses in a variety of colors, with most homes having yards. These yards often contain trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who either are or were raising families. On any given day, children run along the streets, and people can be seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize each other, and it's easy to spot newcomers. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. The lawns are well-maintained, without piles of fall leaves, and the green grass is neatly mowed. If there are plants or bushes, they are kept trimmed. This isn't a neighborhood that impresses with grand homes, but it's one where you sense it's an excellent place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it may look average, it stands out because it embodies what many desire—a secure place to come home to each day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff's department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, providing services to locals. Close by are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and players' names. Our small-town airport is adjacent, and you can hear the sounds of small planes taking off and landing while you're inside or outside. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're eager, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburban neighborhood. In my particular area, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’ll see only well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are nearly identical, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you’ll spot small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you’ll notice newly paved roads. Despite the many families living here, the streets are in excellent condition without any potholes. Most houses are single-story, although there are some two-story homes. We don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house as you might expect for single-family homes. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment setup, where residents use a key to access their mailbox, along with two larger lockers for packages. This is also due to the HOA’s focus on uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood has a blend of rural and suburban characteristics. Consequently, there is plenty of space for everything. We have several community pools that are well-maintained and gated for residents' use. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don’t need to visit a park to exercise, as the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mainly consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In relation to the city, it is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. Most of the expected amenities are available. For instance, there is one mall—not very large but adequate. It takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. These range from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t immediately nearby, it’s easy to drive to any major chain store you’d like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit surprising. Almost every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars a month. Neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. Perhaps it's just the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are pricey, but over the years we've become frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been in storage. You notice smells less as an adult. You might start smoking, or you might just get used to things as they are. But the flea market remains persistent. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It lingers in leather even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, yet inside thrift stores, it's silent. No matter the number of people or cars passing by, the store stays quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people flood in. It's called a developing city. Hosting one of the biggest e-commerce and delivery companies, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and not much is expected of you. You can be quiet and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your shell as long as you want, and the city will move around like waves on a beach. It's an exciting place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, it's less an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. We exchange mail. It's good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern sprawl, but neighbors like mine make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unappealing or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are a bit higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low overall. In the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has only been affected by minor thefts, like items disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources available, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town possesses many positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. He has not experienced any bullying, despite his special needs, thanks to the school’s positive environment, and he loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many visual improvements to our town, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and upgrading city parks. Unfortunately, these enhancements have mostly occurred in the town center and the west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated. The east side, where I live, is often overlooked, causing frustration among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options—both small businesses and larger retail stores—to meet my family's needs. While our home may not hold much value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Located on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater. A block down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. On weekends, particularly in June and July, you can often see people lined up to enter. A few blocks away is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this area of town. The park is bordered by concrete, with tall staircases built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals pitch their tents neatly along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they manage to keep warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish most about my city isn't the beauty of its historical architecture—the tall, proud buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even now, three decades later, stories are told about the federal government and DEA's efforts to clean the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. Stories are still shared across generations, reaching newcomers like me, about those times. Despite being considered one of the tougher areas in the city, residents work hard to maintain it. They care deeply about their community and what happens on their block. There is a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, influenced by outdated social conditioning. Perhaps I blend in enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop views me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism and cultural conditioning that persist in our nation, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valued.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story houses. On warm days or weekends, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the residents. People respect your privacy unless you need assistance. I've ordered numerous packages online, and none have been stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories is from there too when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and enjoy playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now fills me with nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of nearby food options. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are the most popular but are common in most suburbs. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store where you can get ingredients or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories on social media and the news about others' neighbor experiences makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are fun and reasonably priced. One bar recently changed its name and is more expensive, but the service and drinks are decent. The community is friendly, mostly made up of college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments here are affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management placed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings nearby tend to look old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which feels like a rip-off. There's a very cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved, and a gas station across from it that's not reputed to be a great workplace. The road was improved last summer with a new sidewalk and greenery, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps from recent cuts, but it’s more wooded here than down the road. Behind my complex are more apartments, and although I live on 42nd street, 43rd street behind us isn’t as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are many trees on that street, likely to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in my area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, though crime also happens in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make getting to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. They are arranged and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only difference is that each one is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of a random driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing escape from our modern, technology-driven world, almost like going back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. You would have found me in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, staying in the living room, anxious and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the sudden temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun emerged, and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do all the residents, though the interiors vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make much sense to me. I enjoy strolling along the large field behind where I live and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a local farm that brays in the evening to remind us of its presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Given that I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, I suppose I can share my experiences. Initially, I felt quite sad upon moving here. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough, and I even cried because I missed my old friends dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we relocated to a place with better housing and a higher-quality high school—everything was considered more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and encountered some adversaries at school, too. Although I haven't really gotten to know most of my neighbors, I've become acquainted with Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, since they live right next door. They're wonderful people whom I almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding (it was a remarriage) with my family, which was a delightful event. It inspired me to dream of providing my future wife with a queenly life as I build my wealth. I even caught the garter at the wedding, although I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I especially enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great things. The neighborhood feels like a maze, yet with GPS, I'm now more comfortable exploring. I’ve only ventured so far, mostly when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and relish life as much as possible. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and enjoy using my bokken wooden sword. There are basketball and tennis courts here, though I haven’t played in a while. They're available if I decide to revisit those sports. My dad and Mr. Graves introduced my best friend and me to tennis; they pushed us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable times here, and while there are numerous stories I could share, these are the ones that stand out. I truly believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that may not be particularly distinctive among those in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in the agriculture industry. Johnston prides itself on being the Peach Capital of the World, as proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area mainly consists of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses outside the town center are spaced far apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's few stores are situated. There are three options for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. The town's small but pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is where people usually pick up a few items, while most prefer to shop at the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main groceries. The town's most frequented store is Dollar General, bustling from morning to night with its wide selection of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a well-known local woman, has been a fixture in Johnston for many years, offering delivery services through two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service providing daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located away from the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve the Johnston community. Johnston Elementary School is the sole elementary school, with students attending middle and high school in the neighboring town after fifth grade. While there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or pet walking areas, nor a wide array of restaurants, it's a pleasant town that you might easily miss if you blink while passing through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which results in more traffic than I would prefer, but otherwise, the neighborhood is peaceful. Not many residents move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the neighbors. People usually keep busy with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going and recognize the local cars. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles when we see them. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, as you would expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently at the house. There are four of us—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—so others are used to seeing us come and go. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. It seems there's always someone mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawnmower nearly every day from March to October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing lots of shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, feeling more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I like working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host visitors, resulting in extra cars parked around, and it's similar during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the heart of the high desert, where there's an abundance of dirt everywhere. It's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown unless you've lived here. Spotting a lawn means someone is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s, the houses were quite spread out, and while that's still the case, there are many new developments now. Honestly, this area increasingly resembles a city, which is a trend seen in many places. People here are generally friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly people, so it's a pretty nice area. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel elsewhere, as there aren't stores like Whole Foods around. The most common job in my city, though not based on official statistics, seems to be in construction. This is likely because the city is still not very developed, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning for me since I prefer things as they are. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, that's my full-time job; I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The unique climate and terrain have created delicate ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take time to understand these creatures to live together safely. My family and I have adjusted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different ones. We do have some attractions here. For families looking to experience the desert, Victorville offers a unique visit. Try to plan your trip around the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a mix of activities and fun. Also, visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're curious about the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that reflect Victorville's social and industrial development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is likely to be somewhat unusual. While others might answer from the perspective of homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and my dormitory mates are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine has buildings, residents, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 people each. Next, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often rented by alumni. However, these are less common due to their inefficiency. Finally, the dormitories house hundreds of students, usually with two per room, and are the most prevalent housing type here. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood’s population. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dormitories, and older students live in apartments. The character of this neighborhood’s residents is best appreciated in person, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers a wide range of stores along with a single park. The stores provide a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, as well as the school’s unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a communal space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my house is perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers choose to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has several potholes, making driving somewhat risky. Some of the telephone and electric wires in the area look worn out. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often bring down the power lines, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look. However, residents dislike them and try to cut as many as possible because they block the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's beautiful at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange. It's usually cloudy, though, so sunlight is often seen through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, allowing moss to grow on anything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in my area, even though there's a school nearby. Most of my neighbors are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs. It's common to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam the area freely. Some are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most away from our neighborhood. We also have the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide; you can clearly see the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a challenge! The neighborhood is well-served by public transportation, which is a popular choice in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, so you'll still have that quintessential New York City feel. As you explore, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular with locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and the convenience is unmatched. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from each other near my location, which makes accessing groceries very easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asians; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children living here. Most of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds playing and interacting well together. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings, with most structures being co-op or condominium apartments. However, the majority of residences are two-family houses. The residents are generally friendly, but it can be quite noisy. Daily, you'd hear cars blaring music or speeding by, which might wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, stay alert. Although it’s a relatively safe area, unpredictable incidents can occur, such as encountering troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I was once physically assaulted here many years ago, and package theft is also a common issue. Finally, despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, this rule is often ignored in Bensonhurst. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a major annoyance of mine, as dog waste is prevalent throughout the neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, strip club, and only partially adheres to legal boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a city that was less popular and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland maintains its weirdness. Here, \"weird\" doesn't always equate to being accepting but indicates an openness to things typically not embraced. It doesn't mean we lack modern amenities or contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods come from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland has its share of normalcy, with yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Amazingly often, they contain something perfect for a passerby. Typically, they hold clothes and books, but the possibilities are endless. The enchanting possibility of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures what Portland embodies, at least for me. Yet, I’m just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a hub for diverse passions and pursuits. We chase our dreams or dream about them while spending too much time at the bar. It's true that Portland faces a drug issue, which often stems from mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue that remains unsolved. The homeless are attracted by Portland's social services, which surpass those in many regions, yet still fall short, as they do nationwide. The general public oscillates between empathy and animosity. In this regard, Portland is not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the north, observing the sun's rise and set each day. Despite often forgetting them amid the chaos of work and daily life, they remain steadfast and unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, their presence demands my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my anxious spirit, granting me the strength to carry on, day by day. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains captivated me from the start. While the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own right, with numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-driven study sessions. A short walk or bus ride away lies the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an aura of antiquity, revealing the town's bustling energy akin to its urban neighbors. However, this lively atmosphere only stretches a few blocks before the peacefulness of the small town reemerges past the library. This blend of environments in such close proximity gives the city a marvelous vibe, inviting exploration. Here, it's easy to forge cherished memories linked to various parts of town—whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the lively downtown to see a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. Of course, like all places, it also holds some harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or tearful moments during a 2 a.m. existential crisis, which I know all too well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each fulfilling a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate life’s mysteries. I would walk past the pond, through the park and suburban homes, until reaching a main street. At that moment, the sun's brilliant rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky, and I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as always—the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky beyond any building in sight, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—nestled behind a shopping strip in a residential neighborhood, it doesn't seem like a typical place where people would choose to live. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see guests during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a lively community. Here, on these streets, lie several apartment complexes arranged with precision, reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls laid out in a row. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory issues, so we'll steer clear of those—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the neighboring complexes have a distinct character, forming a hidden world unknown to most locals. Across from these complexes, a satellite campus of a community college stands quietly, where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. Iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters grumble about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where patients recover from unfortunate accidents. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Children play in the park, dashing across the grass, while bees hover around the flower beds. Retirees walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the skateboarding teens and nodding politely at the young girls gossiping near the playground. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant offering affordable meals, yet it's never crowded. Adjacent is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can stock up on pool supplies, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once—a testament to the convenience of strip malls. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens from the park often grab a treat to enjoy while showing off skateboarding tricks and vaping, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana—a slice of Southern history where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most homes are single-family, though a few have been converted into duplexes while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like many others, it evokes a not-so-distant past when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, persists in proclaiming to us and visitors alike that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars parked in the driveways, and children play as though their world is all that exists. The public school, which has stood for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire a future in today’s youth while evoking nostalgia among older residents. There are few churches, mostly empty, yet the basketball courts remain busy. Every home looks different, but they share a similar feel. There’s a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many of the neighborhood's residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, the kids lost interest, and it became a pharmacy—since, supposedly, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at a discount, avoiding crowds due to the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders who enjoy a night out at an affordable price, without the kids, of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though the entrance and exit are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would ruin it. The elders eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where different businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, while others include various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. Some stores are large, well-known chains owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular too. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the numerous attractions nearby. There are also a couple of parks close by, which are popular with families and their young children. As for the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is home to people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities. We have areas such as Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city, despite some attractions being nearby, as the city is vast and walking isn’t the preferred mode of travel. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging almost everywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings rising in the city. It seems to be a popular place, but many residents are unhappy about the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment complexes. Residential areas feature houses of different sizes, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, so housing diversity is also present. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It isn’t a close-knit community nowadays, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends of similar age from the neighborhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She came from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her home; she'd never experienced such open space before. As she absorbed the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, the area is alive with newly planted flowers and the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. Driveways showcase high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a welcoming smile. He spends his day mowing the lawn and can often be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he is genuine and has a remarkable past. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my house. In the side yard, geese are often chased by our Terrier. At the back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly meant chasing them, always finding something to do and usually a neighborhood child to play with. Winters in my small town can be harsh yet stunning. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When snow occasionally falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We’d construct massive igloo-like forts to store our ammunition, using branches as an arsenal. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, back when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart or Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to reach any destination. Despite this, I am fortunate to live in one of the most stunning areas of the world, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are readily accessible for a quick dip almost everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren't crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some of which have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many homes have full basements visible from the street, and several feature older aluminum siding. The neighborhood boasts houses in a variety of colors, with most homes having yards. These yards often contain trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who either are or were raising families. On any given day, children run along the streets, and people can be seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize each other, and it's easy to spot newcomers. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. The lawns are well-maintained, without piles of fall leaves, and the green grass is neatly mowed. If there are plants or bushes, they are kept trimmed. This isn't a neighborhood that impresses with grand homes, but it's one where you sense it's an excellent place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it may look average, it stands out because it embodies what many desire—a secure place to come home to each day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff's department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, providing services to locals. Close by are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and players' names. Our small-town airport is adjacent, and you can hear the sounds of small planes taking off and landing while you're inside or outside. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're eager, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburban neighborhood. In my particular area, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’ll see only well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are nearly identical, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you’ll spot small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you’ll notice newly paved roads. Despite the many families living here, the streets are in excellent condition without any potholes. Most houses are single-story, although there are some two-story homes. We don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house as you might expect for single-family homes. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment setup, where residents use a key to access their mailbox, along with two larger lockers for packages. This is also due to the HOA’s focus on uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood has a blend of rural and suburban characteristics. Consequently, there is plenty of space for everything. We have several community pools that are well-maintained and gated for residents' use. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don’t need to visit a park to exercise, as the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mainly consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In relation to the city, it is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. Most of the expected amenities are available. For instance, there is one mall—not very large but adequate. It takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. These range from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t immediately nearby, it’s easy to drive to any major chain store you’d like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit surprising. Almost every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars a month. Neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. Perhaps it's just the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are pricey, but over the years we've become frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been in storage. You notice smells less as an adult. You might start smoking, or you might just get used to things as they are. But the flea market remains persistent. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It lingers in leather even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, yet inside thrift stores, it's silent. No matter the number of people or cars passing by, the store stays quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people flood in. It's called a developing city. Hosting one of the biggest e-commerce and delivery companies, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and not much is expected of you. You can be quiet and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your shell as long as you want, and the city will move around like waves on a beach. It's an exciting place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, it's less an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. We exchange mail. It's good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern sprawl, but neighbors like mine make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unappealing or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are a bit higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low overall. In the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has only been affected by minor thefts, like items disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources available, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town possesses many positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. He has not experienced any bullying, despite his special needs, thanks to the school’s positive environment, and he loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many visual improvements to our town, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and upgrading city parks. Unfortunately, these enhancements have mostly occurred in the town center and the west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated. The east side, where I live, is often overlooked, causing frustration among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options—both small businesses and larger retail stores—to meet my family's needs. While our home may not hold much value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Located on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater. A block down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. On weekends, particularly in June and July, you can often see people lined up to enter. A few blocks away is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this area of town. The park is bordered by concrete, with tall staircases built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals pitch their tents neatly along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they manage to keep warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish most about my city isn't the beauty of its historical architecture—the tall, proud buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even now, three decades later, stories are told about the federal government and DEA's efforts to clean the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. Stories are still shared across generations, reaching newcomers like me, about those times. Despite being considered one of the tougher areas in the city, residents work hard to maintain it. They care deeply about their community and what happens on their block. There is a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, influenced by outdated social conditioning. Perhaps I blend in enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop views me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism and cultural conditioning that persist in our nation, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valued.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story houses. On warm days or weekends, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the residents. People respect your privacy unless you need assistance. I've ordered numerous packages online, and none have been stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories is from there too when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and enjoy playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now fills me with nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of nearby food options. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are the most popular but are common in most suburbs. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store where you can get ingredients or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories on social media and the news about others' neighbor experiences makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are fun and reasonably priced. One bar recently changed its name and is more expensive, but the service and drinks are decent. The community is friendly, mostly made up of college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments here are affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management placed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings nearby tend to look old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which feels like a rip-off. There's a very cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved, and a gas station across from it that's not reputed to be a great workplace. The road was improved last summer with a new sidewalk and greenery, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps from recent cuts, but it’s more wooded here than down the road. Behind my complex are more apartments, and although I live on 42nd street, 43rd street behind us isn’t as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are many trees on that street, likely to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in my area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, though crime also happens in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make getting to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. They are arranged and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only difference is that each one is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of a random driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing escape from our modern, technology-driven world, almost like going back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. You would have found me in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, staying in the living room, anxious and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the sudden temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun emerged, and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do all the residents, though the interiors vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make much sense to me. I enjoy strolling along the large field behind where I live and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a local farm that brays in the evening to remind us of its presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Given that I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, I suppose I can share my experiences. Initially, I felt quite sad upon moving here. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough, and I even cried because I missed my old friends dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we relocated to a place with better housing and a higher-quality high school—everything was considered more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and encountered some adversaries at school, too. Although I haven't really gotten to know most of my neighbors, I've become acquainted with Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, since they live right next door. They're wonderful people whom I almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding (it was a remarriage) with my family, which was a delightful event. It inspired me to dream of providing my future wife with a queenly life as I build my wealth. I even caught the garter at the wedding, although I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I especially enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great things. The neighborhood feels like a maze, yet with GPS, I'm now more comfortable exploring. I’ve only ventured so far, mostly when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and relish life as much as possible. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and enjoy using my bokken wooden sword. There are basketball and tennis courts here, though I haven’t played in a while. They're available if I decide to revisit those sports. My dad and Mr. Graves introduced my best friend and me to tennis; they pushed us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable times here, and while there are numerous stories I could share, these are the ones that stand out. I truly believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that may not be particularly distinctive among those in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in the agriculture industry. Johnston prides itself on being the Peach Capital of the World, as proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area mainly consists of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses outside the town center are spaced far apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's few stores are situated. There are three options for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. The town's small but pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is where people usually pick up a few items, while most prefer to shop at the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main groceries. The town's most frequented store is Dollar General, bustling from morning to night with its wide selection of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a well-known local woman, has been a fixture in Johnston for many years, offering delivery services through two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service providing daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located away from the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve the Johnston community. Johnston Elementary School is the sole elementary school, with students attending middle and high school in the neighboring town after fifth grade. While there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or pet walking areas, nor a wide array of restaurants, it's a pleasant town that you might easily miss if you blink while passing through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which results in more traffic than I would prefer, but otherwise, the neighborhood is peaceful. Not many residents move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the neighbors. People usually keep busy with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going and recognize the local cars. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles when we see them. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, as you would expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently at the house. There are four of us—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—so others are used to seeing us come and go. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. It seems there's always someone mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawnmower nearly every day from March to October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing lots of shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, feeling more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I like working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host visitors, resulting in extra cars parked around, and it's similar during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the heart of the high desert, where there's an abundance of dirt everywhere. It's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown unless you've lived here. Spotting a lawn means someone is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s, the houses were quite spread out, and while that's still the case, there are many new developments now. Honestly, this area increasingly resembles a city, which is a trend seen in many places. People here are generally friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly people, so it's a pretty nice area. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel elsewhere, as there aren't stores like Whole Foods around. The most common job in my city, though not based on official statistics, seems to be in construction. This is likely because the city is still not very developed, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning for me since I prefer things as they are. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, that's my full-time job; I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The unique climate and terrain have created delicate ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take time to understand these creatures to live together safely. My family and I have adjusted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different ones. We do have some attractions here. For families looking to experience the desert, Victorville offers a unique visit. Try to plan your trip around the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a mix of activities and fun. Also, visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're curious about the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that reflect Victorville's social and industrial development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is likely to be somewhat unusual. While others might answer from the perspective of homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and my dormitory mates are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine has buildings, residents, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 people each. Next, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often rented by alumni. However, these are less common due to their inefficiency. Finally, the dormitories house hundreds of students, usually with two per room, and are the most prevalent housing type here. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood’s population. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dormitories, and older students live in apartments. The character of this neighborhood’s residents is best appreciated in person, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers a wide range of stores along with a single park. The stores provide a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, as well as the school’s unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a communal space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my house is perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers choose to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has several potholes, making driving somewhat risky. Some of the telephone and electric wires in the area look worn out. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often bring down the power lines, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look. However, residents dislike them and try to cut as many as possible because they block the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's beautiful at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange. It's usually cloudy, though, so sunlight is often seen through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, allowing moss to grow on anything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in my area, even though there's a school nearby. Most of my neighbors are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs. It's common to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam the area freely. Some are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most away from our neighborhood. We also have the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide; you can clearly see the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a challenge! The neighborhood is well-served by public transportation, which is a popular choice in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, so you'll still have that quintessential New York City feel. As you explore, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular with locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and the convenience is unmatched. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from each other near my location, which makes accessing groceries very easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asians; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children living here. Most of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds playing and interacting well together. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings, with most structures being co-op or condominium apartments. However, the majority of residences are two-family houses. The residents are generally friendly, but it can be quite noisy. Daily, you'd hear cars blaring music or speeding by, which might wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, stay alert. Although it’s a relatively safe area, unpredictable incidents can occur, such as encountering troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I was once physically assaulted here many years ago, and package theft is also a common issue. Finally, despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, this rule is often ignored in Bensonhurst. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a major annoyance of mine, as dog waste is prevalent throughout the neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, strip club, and only partially adheres to legal boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a city that was less popular and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland maintains its weirdness. Here, \"weird\" doesn't always equate to being accepting but indicates an openness to things typically not embraced. It doesn't mean we lack modern amenities or contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods come from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland has its share of normalcy, with yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Amazingly often, they contain something perfect for a passerby. Typically, they hold clothes and books, but the possibilities are endless. The enchanting possibility of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures what Portland embodies, at least for me. Yet, I’m just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a hub for diverse passions and pursuits. We chase our dreams or dream about them while spending too much time at the bar. It's true that Portland faces a drug issue, which often stems from mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue that remains unsolved. The homeless are attracted by Portland's social services, which surpass those in many regions, yet still fall short, as they do nationwide. The general public oscillates between empathy and animosity. In this regard, Portland is not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the north, observing the sun's rise and set each day. Despite often forgetting them amid the chaos of work and daily life, they remain steadfast and unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, their presence demands my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my anxious spirit, granting me the strength to carry on, day by day. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains captivated me from the start. While the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own right, with numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-driven study sessions. A short walk or bus ride away lies the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an aura of antiquity, revealing the town's bustling energy akin to its urban neighbors. However, this lively atmosphere only stretches a few blocks before the peacefulness of the small town reemerges past the library. This blend of environments in such close proximity gives the city a marvelous vibe, inviting exploration. Here, it's easy to forge cherished memories linked to various parts of town—whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the lively downtown to see a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. Of course, like all places, it also holds some harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or tearful moments during a 2 a.m. existential crisis, which I know all too well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each fulfilling a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate life’s mysteries. I would walk past the pond, through the park and suburban homes, until reaching a main street. At that moment, the sun's brilliant rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky, and I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as always—the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky beyond any building in sight, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—nestled behind a shopping strip in a residential neighborhood, it doesn't seem like a typical place where people would choose to live. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see guests during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a lively community. Here, on these streets, lie several apartment complexes arranged with precision, reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls laid out in a row. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory issues, so we'll steer clear of those—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the neighboring complexes have a distinct character, forming a hidden world unknown to most locals. Across from these complexes, a satellite campus of a community college stands quietly, where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. Iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters grumble about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where patients recover from unfortunate accidents. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Children play in the park, dashing across the grass, while bees hover around the flower beds. Retirees walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the skateboarding teens and nodding politely at the young girls gossiping near the playground. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant offering affordable meals, yet it's never crowded. Adjacent is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can stock up on pool supplies, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once—a testament to the convenience of strip malls. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens from the park often grab a treat to enjoy while showing off skateboarding tricks and vaping, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana—a slice of Southern history where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most homes are single-family, though a few have been converted into duplexes while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like many others, it evokes a not-so-distant past when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, persists in proclaiming to us and visitors alike that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars parked in the driveways, and children play as though their world is all that exists. The public school, which has stood for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire a future in today’s youth while evoking nostalgia among older residents. There are few churches, mostly empty, yet the basketball courts remain busy. Every home looks different, but they share a similar feel. There’s a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many of the neighborhood's residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, the kids lost interest, and it became a pharmacy—since, supposedly, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at a discount, avoiding crowds due to the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders who enjoy a night out at an affordable price, without the kids, of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though the entrance and exit are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would ruin it. The elders eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where different businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, while others include various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. Some stores are large, well-known chains owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular too. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the numerous attractions nearby. There are also a couple of parks close by, which are popular with families and their young children. As for the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is home to people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities. We have areas such as Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city, despite some attractions being nearby, as the city is vast and walking isn’t the preferred mode of travel. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging almost everywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings rising in the city. It seems to be a popular place, but many residents are unhappy about the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment complexes. Residential areas feature houses of different sizes, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, so housing diversity is also present. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It isn’t a close-knit community nowadays, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends of similar age from the neighborhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She came from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her home; she'd never experienced such open space before. As she absorbed the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, the area is alive with newly planted flowers and the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. Driveways showcase high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a welcoming smile. He spends his day mowing the lawn and can often be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he is genuine and has a remarkable past. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my house. In the side yard, geese are often chased by our Terrier. At the back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly meant chasing them, always finding something to do and usually a neighborhood child to play with. Winters in my small town can be harsh yet stunning. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When snow occasionally falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We’d construct massive igloo-like forts to store our ammunition, using branches as an arsenal. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, back when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart or Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to reach any destination. Despite this, I am fortunate to live in one of the most stunning areas of the world, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are readily accessible for a quick dip almost everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren't crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some of which have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many homes have full basements visible from the street, and several feature older aluminum siding. The neighborhood boasts houses in a variety of colors, with most homes having yards. These yards often contain trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who either are or were raising families. On any given day, children run along the streets, and people can be seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize each other, and it's easy to spot newcomers. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. The lawns are well-maintained, without piles of fall leaves, and the green grass is neatly mowed. If there are plants or bushes, they are kept trimmed. This isn't a neighborhood that impresses with grand homes, but it's one where you sense it's an excellent place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it may look average, it stands out because it embodies what many desire—a secure place to come home to each day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff's department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, providing services to locals. Close by are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and players' names. Our small-town airport is adjacent, and you can hear the sounds of small planes taking off and landing while you're inside or outside. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're eager, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburban neighborhood. In my particular area, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’ll see only well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are nearly identical, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you’ll spot small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you’ll notice newly paved roads. Despite the many families living here, the streets are in excellent condition without any potholes. Most houses are single-story, although there are some two-story homes. We don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house as you might expect for single-family homes. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment setup, where residents use a key to access their mailbox, along with two larger lockers for packages. This is also due to the HOA’s focus on uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood has a blend of rural and suburban characteristics. Consequently, there is plenty of space for everything. We have several community pools that are well-maintained and gated for residents' use. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don’t need to visit a park to exercise, as the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mainly consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In relation to the city, it is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. Most of the expected amenities are available. For instance, there is one mall—not very large but adequate. It takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. These range from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t immediately nearby, it’s easy to drive to any major chain store you’d like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit surprising. Almost every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars a month. Neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. Perhaps it's just the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are pricey, but over the years we've become frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been in storage. You notice smells less as an adult. You might start smoking, or you might just get used to things as they are. But the flea market remains persistent. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It lingers in leather even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, yet inside thrift stores, it's silent. No matter the number of people or cars passing by, the store stays quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people flood in. It's called a developing city. Hosting one of the biggest e-commerce and delivery companies, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and not much is expected of you. You can be quiet and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your shell as long as you want, and the city will move around like waves on a beach. It's an exciting place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, it's less an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. We exchange mail. It's good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern sprawl, but neighbors like mine make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unappealing or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are a bit higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low overall. In the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has only been affected by minor thefts, like items disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources available, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town possesses many positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. He has not experienced any bullying, despite his special needs, thanks to the school’s positive environment, and he loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many visual improvements to our town, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and upgrading city parks. Unfortunately, these enhancements have mostly occurred in the town center and the west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated. The east side, where I live, is often overlooked, causing frustration among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options—both small businesses and larger retail stores—to meet my family's needs. While our home may not hold much value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Located on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater. A block down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. On weekends, particularly in June and July, you can often see people lined up to enter. A few blocks away is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this area of town. The park is bordered by concrete, with tall staircases built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals pitch their tents neatly along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they manage to keep warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish most about my city isn't the beauty of its historical architecture—the tall, proud buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even now, three decades later, stories are told about the federal government and DEA's efforts to clean the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. Stories are still shared across generations, reaching newcomers like me, about those times. Despite being considered one of the tougher areas in the city, residents work hard to maintain it. They care deeply about their community and what happens on their block. There is a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, influenced by outdated social conditioning. Perhaps I blend in enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop views me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism and cultural conditioning that persist in our nation, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valued.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story houses. On warm days or weekends, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the residents. People respect your privacy unless you need assistance. I've ordered numerous packages online, and none have been stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories is from there too when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and enjoy playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now fills me with nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of nearby food options. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are the most popular but are common in most suburbs. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store where you can get ingredients or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories on social media and the news about others' neighbor experiences makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are fun and reasonably priced. One bar recently changed its name and is more expensive, but the service and drinks are decent. The community is friendly, mostly made up of college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments here are affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management placed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings nearby tend to look old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which feels like a rip-off. There's a very cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved, and a gas station across from it that's not reputed to be a great workplace. The road was improved last summer with a new sidewalk and greenery, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps from recent cuts, but it’s more wooded here than down the road. Behind my complex are more apartments, and although I live on 42nd street, 43rd street behind us isn’t as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are many trees on that street, likely to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in my area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, though crime also happens in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make getting to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. They are arranged and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only difference is that each one is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of a random driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing escape from our modern, technology-driven world, almost like going back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. You would have found me in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, staying in the living room, anxious and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the sudden temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun emerged, and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do all the residents, though the interiors vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make much sense to me. I enjoy strolling along the large field behind where I live and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a local farm that brays in the evening to remind us of its presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Given that I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, I suppose I can share my experiences. Initially, I felt quite sad upon moving here. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough, and I even cried because I missed my old friends dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we relocated to a place with better housing and a higher-quality high school—everything was considered more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and encountered some adversaries at school, too. Although I haven't really gotten to know most of my neighbors, I've become acquainted with Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, since they live right next door. They're wonderful people whom I almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding (it was a remarriage) with my family, which was a delightful event. It inspired me to dream of providing my future wife with a queenly life as I build my wealth. I even caught the garter at the wedding, although I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I especially enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great things. The neighborhood feels like a maze, yet with GPS, I'm now more comfortable exploring. I’ve only ventured so far, mostly when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and relish life as much as possible. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and enjoy using my bokken wooden sword. There are basketball and tennis courts here, though I haven’t played in a while. They're available if I decide to revisit those sports. My dad and Mr. Graves introduced my best friend and me to tennis; they pushed us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable times here, and while there are numerous stories I could share, these are the ones that stand out. I truly believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that may not be particularly distinctive among those in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in the agriculture industry. Johnston prides itself on being the Peach Capital of the World, as proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area mainly consists of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses outside the town center are spaced far apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's few stores are situated. There are three options for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. The town's small but pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is where people usually pick up a few items, while most prefer to shop at the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main groceries. The town's most frequented store is Dollar General, bustling from morning to night with its wide selection of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a well-known local woman, has been a fixture in Johnston for many years, offering delivery services through two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service providing daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located away from the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve the Johnston community. Johnston Elementary School is the sole elementary school, with students attending middle and high school in the neighboring town after fifth grade. While there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or pet walking areas, nor a wide array of restaurants, it's a pleasant town that you might easily miss if you blink while passing through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which results in more traffic than I would prefer, but otherwise, the neighborhood is peaceful. Not many residents move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the neighbors. People usually keep busy with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going and recognize the local cars. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles when we see them. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, as you would expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently at the house. There are four of us—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—so others are used to seeing us come and go. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. It seems there's always someone mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawnmower nearly every day from March to October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing lots of shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, feeling more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I like working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host visitors, resulting in extra cars parked around, and it's similar during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the heart of the high desert, where there's an abundance of dirt everywhere. It's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown unless you've lived here. Spotting a lawn means someone is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s, the houses were quite spread out, and while that's still the case, there are many new developments now. Honestly, this area increasingly resembles a city, which is a trend seen in many places. People here are generally friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly people, so it's a pretty nice area. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel elsewhere, as there aren't stores like Whole Foods around. The most common job in my city, though not based on official statistics, seems to be in construction. This is likely because the city is still not very developed, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning for me since I prefer things as they are. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, that's my full-time job; I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The unique climate and terrain have created delicate ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take time to understand these creatures to live together safely. My family and I have adjusted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different ones. We do have some attractions here. For families looking to experience the desert, Victorville offers a unique visit. Try to plan your trip around the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a mix of activities and fun. Also, visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're curious about the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that reflect Victorville's social and industrial development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is likely to be somewhat unusual. While others might answer from the perspective of homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and my dormitory mates are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine has buildings, residents, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 people each. Next, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often rented by alumni. However, these are less common due to their inefficiency. Finally, the dormitories house hundreds of students, usually with two per room, and are the most prevalent housing type here. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood’s population. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dormitories, and older students live in apartments. The character of this neighborhood’s residents is best appreciated in person, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers a wide range of stores along with a single park. The stores provide a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, as well as the school’s unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a communal space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my house is perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers choose to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has several potholes, making driving somewhat risky. Some of the telephone and electric wires in the area look worn out. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often bring down the power lines, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look. However, residents dislike them and try to cut as many as possible because they block the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's beautiful at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange. It's usually cloudy, though, so sunlight is often seen through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, allowing moss to grow on anything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in my area, even though there's a school nearby. Most of my neighbors are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs. It's common to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam the area freely. Some are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most away from our neighborhood. We also have the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide; you can clearly see the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a challenge! The neighborhood is well-served by public transportation, which is a popular choice in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, so you'll still have that quintessential New York City feel. As you explore, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular with locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and the convenience is unmatched. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from each other near my location, which makes accessing groceries very easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asians; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children living here. Most of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds playing and interacting well together. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings, with most structures being co-op or condominium apartments. However, the majority of residences are two-family houses. The residents are generally friendly, but it can be quite noisy. Daily, you'd hear cars blaring music or speeding by, which might wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, stay alert. Although it’s a relatively safe area, unpredictable incidents can occur, such as encountering troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I was once physically assaulted here many years ago, and package theft is also a common issue. Finally, despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, this rule is often ignored in Bensonhurst. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a major annoyance of mine, as dog waste is prevalent throughout the neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, strip club, and only partially adheres to legal boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a city that was less popular and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland maintains its weirdness. Here, \"weird\" doesn't always equate to being accepting but indicates an openness to things typically not embraced. It doesn't mean we lack modern amenities or contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods come from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland has its share of normalcy, with yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Amazingly often, they contain something perfect for a passerby. Typically, they hold clothes and books, but the possibilities are endless. The enchanting possibility of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures what Portland embodies, at least for me. Yet, I’m just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a hub for diverse passions and pursuits. We chase our dreams or dream about them while spending too much time at the bar. It's true that Portland faces a drug issue, which often stems from mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue that remains unsolved. The homeless are attracted by Portland's social services, which surpass those in many regions, yet still fall short, as they do nationwide. The general public oscillates between empathy and animosity. In this regard, Portland is not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the north, observing the sun's rise and set each day. Despite often forgetting them amid the chaos of work and daily life, they remain steadfast and unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, their presence demands my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my anxious spirit, granting me the strength to carry on, day by day. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains captivated me from the start. While the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own right, with numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-driven study sessions. A short walk or bus ride away lies the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an aura of antiquity, revealing the town's bustling energy akin to its urban neighbors. However, this lively atmosphere only stretches a few blocks before the peacefulness of the small town reemerges past the library. This blend of environments in such close proximity gives the city a marvelous vibe, inviting exploration. Here, it's easy to forge cherished memories linked to various parts of town—whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the lively downtown to see a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. Of course, like all places, it also holds some harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or tearful moments during a 2 a.m. existential crisis, which I know all too well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each fulfilling a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate life’s mysteries. I would walk past the pond, through the park and suburban homes, until reaching a main street. At that moment, the sun's brilliant rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky, and I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as always—the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky beyond any building in sight, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—nestled behind a shopping strip in a residential neighborhood, it doesn't seem like a typical place where people would choose to live. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see guests during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a lively community. Here, on these streets, lie several apartment complexes arranged with precision, reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls laid out in a row. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory issues, so we'll steer clear of those—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the neighboring complexes have a distinct character, forming a hidden world unknown to most locals. Across from these complexes, a satellite campus of a community college stands quietly, where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. Iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters grumble about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where patients recover from unfortunate accidents. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Children play in the park, dashing across the grass, while bees hover around the flower beds. Retirees walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the skateboarding teens and nodding politely at the young girls gossiping near the playground. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant offering affordable meals, yet it's never crowded. Adjacent is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can stock up on pool supplies, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once—a testament to the convenience of strip malls. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens from the park often grab a treat to enjoy while showing off skateboarding tricks and vaping, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana—a slice of Southern history where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most homes are single-family, though a few have been converted into duplexes while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like many others, it evokes a not-so-distant past when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, persists in proclaiming to us and visitors alike that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars parked in the driveways, and children play as though their world is all that exists. The public school, which has stood for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire a future in today’s youth while evoking nostalgia among older residents. There are few churches, mostly empty, yet the basketball courts remain busy. Every home looks different, but they share a similar feel. There’s a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many of the neighborhood's residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, the kids lost interest, and it became a pharmacy—since, supposedly, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at a discount, avoiding crowds due to the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders who enjoy a night out at an affordable price, without the kids, of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though the entrance and exit are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would ruin it. The elders eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where different businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, while others include various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. Some stores are large, well-known chains owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular too. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the numerous attractions nearby. There are also a couple of parks close by, which are popular with families and their young children. As for the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is home to people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities. We have areas such as Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city, despite some attractions being nearby, as the city is vast and walking isn’t the preferred mode of travel. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging almost everywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings rising in the city. It seems to be a popular place, but many residents are unhappy about the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment complexes. Residential areas feature houses of different sizes, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, so housing diversity is also present. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It isn’t a close-knit community nowadays, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends of similar age from the neighborhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She came from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her home; she'd never experienced such open space before. As she absorbed the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, the area is alive with newly planted flowers and the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. Driveways showcase high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a welcoming smile. He spends his day mowing the lawn and can often be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he is genuine and has a remarkable past. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my house. In the side yard, geese are often chased by our Terrier. At the back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly meant chasing them, always finding something to do and usually a neighborhood child to play with. Winters in my small town can be harsh yet stunning. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When snow occasionally falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We’d construct massive igloo-like forts to store our ammunition, using branches as an arsenal. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, back when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree children."
