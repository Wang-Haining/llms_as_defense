            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where the landscape transitions from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Any destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most picturesque areas in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful and easily accessible for a quick visit. My neighborhood embodies the small-town spirit. The houses are not densely packed nor are they identical; instead, they are older homes, some renovated and others retaining their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses feature older aluminum siding, and you can find homes in every color imaginable around mine. Most residences have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some people maintain gardens, while others have fenced areas for their pets. The houses reflect the character of Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, and people are often out walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize and greet each other, identifying those who belong and those who do not. It's common to see someone grilling outside or to exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left from autumn. The green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are trimmed. Although not a neighborhood that impresses with upscale homes, it conveys a sense of being a great place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While its appearance is average, it stands out for embodying what people desire most: a secure place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department adjacent. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving both neighbors and city residents. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is nearby, and the sound of small planes taking off and landing is familiar whether you're inside or out. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, downtown is within reach from our residential area. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice nothing but well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards all look quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see small trees as well. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved concrete. Although many different families live here, the roads are in excellent condition, free from potholes and the like. Most houses are single-story, though you'll occasionally see two-story ones as well. We don't have the usual mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, similar to apartments. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, the HOA and their focus on uniformity are to thank for this. My house is located at the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood is partly rural and partly suburban. This provides us with plenty of land for various purposes. There are several community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough for running around to get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. Alongside them, there's a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect and rely on. For example, we have one mall, which isn't huge but serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, I find a wide variety of stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with a limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have many nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn't right next door, a short drive will take you to any major chain you desire.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast discussing missing persons. It was somewhat surprising, as nearly every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars monthly. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Perhaps it's about the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You begin to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes with mothball odors. You notice smells less as an adult. You may start smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. But the flea market is always distinct. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It settles into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores nearby. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. Regardless of how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon, and more of those afternoons come each year as the city grows. Cars and people flood the area. It's a developing city, known for hosting one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it still faces growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you like, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's an energetic place to be. With the pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, our apartment is less about strangers and more about a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help when needed. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. I deliver their mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, but it's neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban fringe of a major city. My neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by people with low incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are usually friendly and often greet me with a smile when I pass by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks in the last decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Last year, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Luckily, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item vanishing from our porch if left outside. Overall, my town has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many parts of the U.S., with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources in the town to address this crisis, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these issues, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying due to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to an inability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most improvements have been focused on the town center and the west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options, both small businesses and large retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be very valuable, but it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and set on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down from my place, there's a trendy arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up the hill is the closest city park, which is quite large given its location. The park is encircled by concrete with tall stairs built into the walls. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy winter rains make it challenging to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than on the outskirts, they can keep warmer. They're also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can wash and shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I cherish about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even thirty years later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher neighborhoods, the locals strive to maintain its cleanliness and care deeply about their city and block. There's an old warning that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning harks back to the past and is tinged with social conditioning. Maybe I blend in enough to not be seen as completely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the societal issues that linger nationwide. These reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance persist, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel invigorated walking its streets at night, encountering people more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open longer so I could charge my phone when I had no shelter from the rain. It's where I've sat, thinking myself invisible, only for someone to notice, hand me $5, and remind me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but eventually, I became close with someone who lived two houses away and another friend from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I can hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the neighbors, and you're generally left in peace unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose during football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy swings and slides. The park now brings a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of food options within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food is popular, as in most suburbs, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, such as an Indian-owned store for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I really enjoy my neighborhood. Reading about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently changed its name and has become pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly college students and lower-income individuals, as the apartments are relatively cheap. There's an elementary school nearby, so there are many children around. Although I don't interact with my neighbors, I'm not inclined to either. They smoke a lot of marijuana, prompting management to place an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly insulting. The buildings nearby typically appear old but may have updated interiors. A short distance away, new apartments have been constructed, but I don't favor them due to their poor construction and high rent, which I view as a rip-off justified by their proximity to campus. Close by is a very affordable restaurant that serves food on paper plates and mostly reheats it in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station that reportedly isn’t a great place to work. Recently, the city improved the road, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but it's still more wooded than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street behind it is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and run-down buildings. The abundance of trees there likely serves to conceal the buildings' condition. Most crime in the area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but there are also issues with crime and a transient population in the apartments across from me. Despite this, I like my neighborhood. It's affordable and conveniently located, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby, making trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They are scattered and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow, has white porches, and features green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of an unassigned driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This experience is a refreshing break from the modern world's focus on technology and computers. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies and fluffy clouds. The only drawback this season is the tornado warnings. Last night, for the first time, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my bigger dog refused to come into the bathroom, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road steamed due to the temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees within minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the warm pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I hurried inside to grab my camera and captured the scene to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooking. This neighborhood is very welcoming for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else here. Although all the houses look identical on the outside, the apartments differ inside, with some being surprisingly small. It puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which is not meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a large bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like residing in a small village community. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. I was fortunate to discover this delightful neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for around 10 years, I think I can share my experiences. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I was quite sad. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was tough, and I cried because I missed my old friends and loved ones. However, my parents wanted a better environment for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and a nicer high school, far from what we considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends and some enemies at school. I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value them. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyous occasion. I caught the garter, but missed the bouquet! We danced all night, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, although I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I explore it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis to play video games and make the most of life. I find peace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and occasionally bring my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, despite the hard work. I've had many enjoyable moments here, and while these are some highlights, I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not be distinctive among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as highlighted on its welcome sign. The area is mainly made up of farmland with peach trees or cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart; most are two-story with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or have gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing for front fields used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are found. For \"fast food,\" you can choose between Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There was once a pizzeria, but it closed recently. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's small, pricey grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Despite being the sole grocery store, many residents only buy a few items there, preferring to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known community member, which has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Attached to this store is a pet grooming facility, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's office and veterinary practice are located outside the town center; both are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there are no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might pass through without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's a generally quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. Neighbors mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located on the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars people drive around here. We tend to notice unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes as you might expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and me. So, I imagine others are used to seeing us come and go, too. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, which fills the air with a pleasant aroma. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March until around October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees because it was originally a wooded area, providing plenty of shade, but also an abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a nice indicator that fall has arrived. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, it's quite peaceful here. Thanksgiving brings some visiting families, and extra cars are parked everywhere, similar to other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a lawn, you know the owner is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely scattered. It's still largely the same, but there have been many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to resemble a city more and more each day, though I suppose that's a common trend everywhere. While most people here are quite friendly, just like any city, there are good areas and bad ones. I live in a neighborhood surrounded by welcoming elderly folks, so it's probably one of the nicer areas. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale options, you have to travel a bit; there aren't any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, though this is just my observation and not based on official statistics. This might be because the city is still underdeveloped, with lots of open land left to build on, which worries me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and have no desire to return. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field—I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here is the variety of wildlife. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert's climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these non-human neighbors to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, all of whom are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun, the Victorville way. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that tell the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I have a somewhat distinct perspective. Unlike many who might describe their neighborhoods as homeowners with separate lives, my experience is a bit different. I see the college campus where I reside as my neighborhood, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also view the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area before delving into them. There are three main housing options nearby: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with each floor containing about 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 residents each. The standalone houses are available for rent by those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom configurations. These houses are few and scattered, as they are less space-efficient. Lastly, the dormitories, which are the most prevalent, house hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room, with some exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the residents. My school prides itself on diversity, reflected in the cultural and age variety of those living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff reside in the on-campus houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so let’s discuss the shops and parks. My school functions as a self-sufficient neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's own branded clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, anything needed is accessible within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse residents and is kept clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. My house is perched atop the steepest hill around, which slopes downward. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" because it's popular with joggers as part of their exercise routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians use the road, which has a few potholes that make driving a bit risky. Some telephone and power lines in the area look ragged due to frequent storms that knock down branches and debris, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere, but residents often cut them down to enhance the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay's scenery. The view is stunning at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, though it's mostly cloudy, making the sunlight appear through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, with moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. There aren't many children here, despite a nearby school; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often seen in yards or running down the street, sometimes sneaking into open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to guide it outside. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in our neighborhood. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, along with the occasional hawk or eagle, until they are chased off by crows. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is a popular way to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. As you explore, be ready to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll come across an Asian-owned store nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly common. These businesses are favored by locals because they offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are very convenient. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping very convenient. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for summer fun. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds enjoying them. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family houses. People here are generally nice but can be quite noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which might wake you up. If you visit at night, stay alert. While the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, and package theft is a recent issue. Although New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, many people here disregard this rule. Every morning, you'll likely spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is seeing dog waste everywhere, so watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The city's unofficial motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes skirting the law—says \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this serves as a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a city less famous and costly, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weirdness here doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what is usually not accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of the nation, most of what we purchase comes from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. The city has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take everything a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, we have vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes during summer. Free boxes, typically cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items someone no longer wants, often containing a perfect treasure for a passerby. They usually have clothes and books, but can include anything. The enchanting experience of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me—though I'm just one among many types of weird here. Some locals wouldn't dream of choosing clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might attend goat yoga (yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is filled with people who love diverse things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream of doing so while spending excessive time at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which often stems from mental health issues exacerbated by the frequent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, but these are inadequate, much like elsewhere in the country. Residents' attitudes towards the homeless fluctuate between compassion and disdain, making us not so weird in this aspect.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun’s path at every dawn and dusk. Even when I overlook them, distracted by work and life, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand attention, and when I finally notice them, they offer solace to my anxious mind, giving me the strength to continue, one day at a time. I moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were the first to capture my attention. The university is also filled with stunning sights—buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured my heart—but the mountains reign supreme. The rest of the town has its own beauty. There are numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride downtown reveals an old-world charm with faded colored bricks adorning the restaurants and office buildings, where the town matches the hustle of its neighboring city. This lively atmosphere only spans a few blocks, and soon you can escape back to the quiet small town feel by passing the library. This close contrast of environments gives the city a magical appeal, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories tied to different parts of town. Whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. Yet, like all places, it holds some harsh memories. The ponds are particularly suited for reflection or late-night cries during existential crises, an experience I know well. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives with purpose makes me question my own as I navigate life’s mysteries. I walked past the pond, through the park, and past suburban homes until I reached a main street. Then, as sunlight streamed over the palm trees and painted the sky, I realized I was heading north. As expected, the mountains were there, towering over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this place—it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect people to live, or at least not where most would choose to. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels occupied mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. Along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls meticulously arranged along the road. The first ones you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory activities, so we'll gloss over those—appearances can be misleading, after all. Yet, the apartments next to them and the two adjacent complexes offer a world almost unknown to the local residents. Across from these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their early mornings. The iron gates creak open for them, while commuters express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road meets another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm air. Children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at teenage girls chatting by the playground about boys and YouTube trends. A sushi restaurant in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable food but rarely sees a crowd. Next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one place—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold cups of yogurt topped with sweets, skateboarding and vaping in the park, thinking it's the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most residences are single-family homes, but some have been divided into two units while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like the majority of homes here, it evokes a time when suburban living was considered the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation but is now fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others persist, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were; the upkeep of small yards has declined. However, driveways still hold a car or two, and children play as if their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, inspiring the youth with a sense of future while evoking nostalgia among older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, yet basketball courts remain bustling. Although the homes all look different, they have a similar feel. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the area. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have been here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but with the decline of karate-themed movies, it has been replaced by a pharmacy, suggesting that medication solves problems, or so they say. There's also a small movie theater that screens classic films at reduced prices, unpopular with the youth due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable night out, sans children. An expressway runs through town, though its exit and entrance are located in the neighboring town. A petition once proposed an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by elders who felt it would harm the community. The elders eventually convinced the city council to reject it. A new high school is under construction, and we're deciding on a mascot. I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent our town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a wide range of businesses operate. These include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is an abundance of new dining options and places to shop. Some shops are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are gaining popularity, too. They can be found in malls and along streets, close to neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the many attractions nearby. There are also a few parks close by, where I've noticed many people take their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's significant diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, there is a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even short distances can mean long drives; traveling 10 miles can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city. Although some attractions are nearby, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging. Despite this, there's been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone lives, or wants to live, in large apartment complexes. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties host single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This diversity in housing is present even in my immediate neighborhood. The community consists of people of all ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community anymore, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the vast, open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home, and she had never encountered so much open space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I shared my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she began to understand who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry, beyond which lies the small community I call home. The houses, primarily made of brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In the spring, flowers are planted in abundance, and the trees reflect the changing seasons characteristic of the Midwest. The driveways are filled with top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz luxury cars, gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue towards my grey stucco house, you’ll likely see my Korean neighbor outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, singing along over the sound of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he remains sincere and has a fascinating history. Although he has grown older and lost some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam around, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, there was always an adventure waiting and usually a neighborhood child to share it with. Winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they hold a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant flowers become bare, skeletal structures. Occasionally, when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would construct large igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, often using branches. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where the landscape transitions from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Any destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most picturesque areas in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful and easily accessible for a quick visit. My neighborhood embodies the small-town spirit. The houses are not densely packed nor are they identical; instead, they are older homes, some renovated and others retaining their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses feature older aluminum siding, and you can find homes in every color imaginable around mine. Most residences have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some people maintain gardens, while others have fenced areas for their pets. The houses reflect the character of Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, and people are often out walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize and greet each other, identifying those who belong and those who do not. It's common to see someone grilling outside or to exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left from autumn. The green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are trimmed. Although not a neighborhood that impresses with upscale homes, it conveys a sense of being a great place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While its appearance is average, it stands out for embodying what people desire most: a secure place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department adjacent. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving both neighbors and city residents. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is nearby, and the sound of small planes taking off and landing is familiar whether you're inside or out. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, downtown is within reach from our residential area. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice nothing but well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards all look quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see small trees as well. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved concrete. Although many different families live here, the roads are in excellent condition, free from potholes and the like. Most houses are single-story, though you'll occasionally see two-story ones as well. We don't have the usual mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, similar to apartments. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, the HOA and their focus on uniformity are to thank for this. My house is located at the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood is partly rural and partly suburban. This provides us with plenty of land for various purposes. There are several community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough for running around to get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. Alongside them, there's a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect and rely on. For example, we have one mall, which isn't huge but serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, I find a wide variety of stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with a limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have many nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn't right next door, a short drive will take you to any major chain you desire.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast discussing missing persons. It was somewhat surprising, as nearly every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars monthly. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Perhaps it's about the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You begin to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes with mothball odors. You notice smells less as an adult. You may start smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. But the flea market is always distinct. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It settles into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores nearby. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. Regardless of how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon, and more of those afternoons come each year as the city grows. Cars and people flood the area. It's a developing city, known for hosting one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it still faces growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you like, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's an energetic place to be. With the pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, our apartment is less about strangers and more about a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help when needed. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. I deliver their mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, but it's neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban fringe of a major city. My neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by people with low incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are usually friendly and often greet me with a smile when I pass by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks in the last decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Last year, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Luckily, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item vanishing from our porch if left outside. Overall, my town has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many parts of the U.S., with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources in the town to address this crisis, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these issues, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying due to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to an inability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most improvements have been focused on the town center and the west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options, both small businesses and large retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be very valuable, but it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and set on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down from my place, there's a trendy arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up the hill is the closest city park, which is quite large given its location. The park is encircled by concrete with tall stairs built into the walls. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy winter rains make it challenging to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than on the outskirts, they can keep warmer. They're also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can wash and shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I cherish about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even thirty years later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher neighborhoods, the locals strive to maintain its cleanliness and care deeply about their city and block. There's an old warning that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning harks back to the past and is tinged with social conditioning. Maybe I blend in enough to not be seen as completely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the societal issues that linger nationwide. These reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance persist, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel invigorated walking its streets at night, encountering people more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open longer so I could charge my phone when I had no shelter from the rain. It's where I've sat, thinking myself invisible, only for someone to notice, hand me $5, and remind me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but eventually, I became close with someone who lived two houses away and another friend from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I can hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the neighbors, and you're generally left in peace unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose during football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy swings and slides. The park now brings a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of food options within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food is popular, as in most suburbs, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, such as an Indian-owned store for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I really enjoy my neighborhood. Reading about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently changed its name and has become pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly college students and lower-income individuals, as the apartments are relatively cheap. There's an elementary school nearby, so there are many children around. Although I don't interact with my neighbors, I'm not inclined to either. They smoke a lot of marijuana, prompting management to place an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly insulting. The buildings nearby typically appear old but may have updated interiors. A short distance away, new apartments have been constructed, but I don't favor them due to their poor construction and high rent, which I view as a rip-off justified by their proximity to campus. Close by is a very affordable restaurant that serves food on paper plates and mostly reheats it in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station that reportedly isn’t a great place to work. Recently, the city improved the road, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but it's still more wooded than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street behind it is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and run-down buildings. The abundance of trees there likely serves to conceal the buildings' condition. Most crime in the area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but there are also issues with crime and a transient population in the apartments across from me. Despite this, I like my neighborhood. It's affordable and conveniently located, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby, making trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They are scattered and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow, has white porches, and features green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of an unassigned driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This experience is a refreshing break from the modern world's focus on technology and computers. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies and fluffy clouds. The only drawback this season is the tornado warnings. Last night, for the first time, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my bigger dog refused to come into the bathroom, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road steamed due to the temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees within minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the warm pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I hurried inside to grab my camera and captured the scene to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooking. This neighborhood is very welcoming for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else here. Although all the houses look identical on the outside, the apartments differ inside, with some being surprisingly small. It puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which is not meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a large bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like residing in a small village community. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. I was fortunate to discover this delightful neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for around 10 years, I think I can share my experiences. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I was quite sad. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was tough, and I cried because I missed my old friends and loved ones. However, my parents wanted a better environment for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and a nicer high school, far from what we considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends and some enemies at school. I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value them. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyous occasion. I caught the garter, but missed the bouquet! We danced all night, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, although I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I explore it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis to play video games and make the most of life. I find peace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and occasionally bring my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, despite the hard work. I've had many enjoyable moments here, and while these are some highlights, I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not be distinctive among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as highlighted on its welcome sign. The area is mainly made up of farmland with peach trees or cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart; most are two-story with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or have gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing for front fields used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are found. For \"fast food,\" you can choose between Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There was once a pizzeria, but it closed recently. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's small, pricey grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Despite being the sole grocery store, many residents only buy a few items there, preferring to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known community member, which has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Attached to this store is a pet grooming facility, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's office and veterinary practice are located outside the town center; both are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there are no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might pass through without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's a generally quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. Neighbors mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located on the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars people drive around here. We tend to notice unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes as you might expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and me. So, I imagine others are used to seeing us come and go, too. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, which fills the air with a pleasant aroma. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March until around October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees because it was originally a wooded area, providing plenty of shade, but also an abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a nice indicator that fall has arrived. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, it's quite peaceful here. Thanksgiving brings some visiting families, and extra cars are parked everywhere, similar to other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a lawn, you know the owner is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely scattered. It's still largely the same, but there have been many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to resemble a city more and more each day, though I suppose that's a common trend everywhere. While most people here are quite friendly, just like any city, there are good areas and bad ones. I live in a neighborhood surrounded by welcoming elderly folks, so it's probably one of the nicer areas. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale options, you have to travel a bit; there aren't any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, though this is just my observation and not based on official statistics. This might be because the city is still underdeveloped, with lots of open land left to build on, which worries me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and have no desire to return. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field—I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here is the variety of wildlife. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert's climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these non-human neighbors to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, all of whom are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun, the Victorville way. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that tell the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I have a somewhat distinct perspective. Unlike many who might describe their neighborhoods as homeowners with separate lives, my experience is a bit different. I see the college campus where I reside as my neighborhood, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also view the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area before delving into them. There are three main housing options nearby: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with each floor containing about 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 residents each. The standalone houses are available for rent by those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom configurations. These houses are few and scattered, as they are less space-efficient. Lastly, the dormitories, which are the most prevalent, house hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room, with some exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the residents. My school prides itself on diversity, reflected in the cultural and age variety of those living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff reside in the on-campus houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so let’s discuss the shops and parks. My school functions as a self-sufficient neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's own branded clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, anything needed is accessible within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse residents and is kept clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. My house is perched atop the steepest hill around, which slopes downward. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" because it's popular with joggers as part of their exercise routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians use the road, which has a few potholes that make driving a bit risky. Some telephone and power lines in the area look ragged due to frequent storms that knock down branches and debris, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere, but residents often cut them down to enhance the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay's scenery. The view is stunning at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, though it's mostly cloudy, making the sunlight appear through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, with moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. There aren't many children here, despite a nearby school; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often seen in yards or running down the street, sometimes sneaking into open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to guide it outside. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in our neighborhood. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, along with the occasional hawk or eagle, until they are chased off by crows. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is a popular way to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. As you explore, be ready to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll come across an Asian-owned store nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly common. These businesses are favored by locals because they offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are very convenient. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping very convenient. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for summer fun. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds enjoying them. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family houses. People here are generally nice but can be quite noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which might wake you up. If you visit at night, stay alert. While the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, and package theft is a recent issue. Although New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, many people here disregard this rule. Every morning, you'll likely spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is seeing dog waste everywhere, so watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The city's unofficial motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes skirting the law—says \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this serves as a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a city less famous and costly, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weirdness here doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what is usually not accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of the nation, most of what we purchase comes from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. The city has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take everything a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, we have vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes during summer. Free boxes, typically cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items someone no longer wants, often containing a perfect treasure for a passerby. They usually have clothes and books, but can include anything. The enchanting experience of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me—though I'm just one among many types of weird here. Some locals wouldn't dream of choosing clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might attend goat yoga (yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is filled with people who love diverse things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream of doing so while spending excessive time at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which often stems from mental health issues exacerbated by the frequent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, but these are inadequate, much like elsewhere in the country. Residents' attitudes towards the homeless fluctuate between compassion and disdain, making us not so weird in this aspect.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun’s path at every dawn and dusk. Even when I overlook them, distracted by work and life, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand attention, and when I finally notice them, they offer solace to my anxious mind, giving me the strength to continue, one day at a time. I moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were the first to capture my attention. The university is also filled with stunning sights—buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured my heart—but the mountains reign supreme. The rest of the town has its own beauty. There are numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride downtown reveals an old-world charm with faded colored bricks adorning the restaurants and office buildings, where the town matches the hustle of its neighboring city. This lively atmosphere only spans a few blocks, and soon you can escape back to the quiet small town feel by passing the library. This close contrast of environments gives the city a magical appeal, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories tied to different parts of town. Whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. Yet, like all places, it holds some harsh memories. The ponds are particularly suited for reflection or late-night cries during existential crises, an experience I know well. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives with purpose makes me question my own as I navigate life’s mysteries. I walked past the pond, through the park, and past suburban homes until I reached a main street. Then, as sunlight streamed over the palm trees and painted the sky, I realized I was heading north. As expected, the mountains were there, towering over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this place—it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect people to live, or at least not where most would choose to. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels occupied mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. Along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls meticulously arranged along the road. The first ones you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory activities, so we'll gloss over those—appearances can be misleading, after all. Yet, the apartments next to them and the two adjacent complexes offer a world almost unknown to the local residents. Across from these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their early mornings. The iron gates creak open for them, while commuters express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road meets another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm air. Children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at teenage girls chatting by the playground about boys and YouTube trends. A sushi restaurant in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable food but rarely sees a crowd. Next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one place—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold cups of yogurt topped with sweets, skateboarding and vaping in the park, thinking it's the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most residences are single-family homes, but some have been divided into two units while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like the majority of homes here, it evokes a time when suburban living was considered the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation but is now fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others persist, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were; the upkeep of small yards has declined. However, driveways still hold a car or two, and children play as if their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, inspiring the youth with a sense of future while evoking nostalgia among older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, yet basketball courts remain bustling. Although the homes all look different, they have a similar feel. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the area. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have been here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but with the decline of karate-themed movies, it has been replaced by a pharmacy, suggesting that medication solves problems, or so they say. There's also a small movie theater that screens classic films at reduced prices, unpopular with the youth due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable night out, sans children. An expressway runs through town, though its exit and entrance are located in the neighboring town. A petition once proposed an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by elders who felt it would harm the community. The elders eventually convinced the city council to reject it. A new high school is under construction, and we're deciding on a mascot. I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent our town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a wide range of businesses operate. These include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is an abundance of new dining options and places to shop. Some shops are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are gaining popularity, too. They can be found in malls and along streets, close to neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the many attractions nearby. There are also a few parks close by, where I've noticed many people take their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's significant diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, there is a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even short distances can mean long drives; traveling 10 miles can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city. Although some attractions are nearby, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging. Despite this, there's been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone lives, or wants to live, in large apartment complexes. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties host single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This diversity in housing is present even in my immediate neighborhood. The community consists of people of all ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community anymore, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the vast, open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home, and she had never encountered so much open space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I shared my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she began to understand who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry, beyond which lies the small community I call home. The houses, primarily made of brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In the spring, flowers are planted in abundance, and the trees reflect the changing seasons characteristic of the Midwest. The driveways are filled with top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz luxury cars, gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue towards my grey stucco house, you’ll likely see my Korean neighbor outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, singing along over the sound of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he remains sincere and has a fascinating history. Although he has grown older and lost some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam around, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, there was always an adventure waiting and usually a neighborhood child to share it with. Winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they hold a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant flowers become bare, skeletal structures. Occasionally, when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would construct large igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, often using branches. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where the landscape transitions from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Any destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most picturesque areas in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful and easily accessible for a quick visit. My neighborhood embodies the small-town spirit. The houses are not densely packed nor are they identical; instead, they are older homes, some renovated and others retaining their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses feature older aluminum siding, and you can find homes in every color imaginable around mine. Most residences have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some people maintain gardens, while others have fenced areas for their pets. The houses reflect the character of Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, and people are often out walking their dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize and greet each other, identifying those who belong and those who do not. It's common to see someone grilling outside or to exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left from autumn. The green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are trimmed. Although not a neighborhood that impresses with upscale homes, it conveys a sense of being a great place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While its appearance is average, it stands out for embodying what people desire most: a secure place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department adjacent. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving both neighbors and city residents. Nearby baseball and softball fields echo with announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is nearby, and the sound of small planes taking off and landing is familiar whether you're inside or out. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, downtown is within reach from our residential area. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, just about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice nothing but well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards all look quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see small trees as well. Every home has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice freshly paved concrete. Although many different families live here, the roads are in excellent condition, free from potholes and the like. Most houses are single-story, though you'll occasionally see two-story ones as well. We don't have the usual mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there's a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, similar to apartments. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, the HOA and their focus on uniformity are to thank for this. My house is located at the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood is partly rural and partly suburban. This provides us with plenty of land for various purposes. There are several community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough for running around to get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other. Alongside them, there's a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large by population but retains a small-town feel. We have most of the amenities you'd expect and rely on. For example, we have one mall, which isn't huge but serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, I find a wide variety of stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic food to bargain outlets with a limited selection and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have many nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn't right next door, a short drive will take you to any major chain you desire.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast discussing missing persons. It was somewhat surprising, as nearly every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars monthly. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Perhaps it's about the struggle. Several of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Things are pricey, but over time, we've learned to be thrifty. You begin to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes with mothball odors. You notice smells less as an adult. You may start smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. But the flea market is always distinct. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It settles into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores nearby. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never hear it inside the thrift stores. Regardless of how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon, and more of those afternoons come each year as the city grows. Cars and people flood the area. It's a developing city, known for hosting one of the largest online e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it still faces growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you like, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's an energetic place to be. With the pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, our apartment is less about strangers and more about a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help when needed. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. I deliver their mail, and they do the same for me. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, but it's neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban fringe of a major city. My neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by people with low incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are usually friendly and often greet me with a smile when I pass by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks in the last decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Last year, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar. Luckily, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item vanishing from our porch if left outside. Overall, my town has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many parts of the U.S., with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are numerous resources in the town to address this crisis, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these issues, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying due to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational progress. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to an inability to pay, and school fees, supplies, and field trips are affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most improvements have been focused on the town center and the west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options, both small businesses and large retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be very valuable, but it is comfortable and suitable. We've lived here for over 16 years and cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture and set on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down from my place, there's a trendy arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up the hill is the closest city park, which is quite large given its location. The park is encircled by concrete with tall stairs built into the walls. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy winter rains make it challenging to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than on the outskirts, they can keep warmer. They're also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can wash and shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I cherish about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even thirty years later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. These stories are passed down through generations, even to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's rougher neighborhoods, the locals strive to maintain its cleanliness and care deeply about their city and block. There's an old warning that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning harks back to the past and is tinged with social conditioning. Maybe I blend in enough to not be seen as completely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the societal issues that linger nationwide. These reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance persist, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. No matter where I go, Hilltop will always be home. I feel invigorated walking its streets at night, encountering people more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open longer so I could charge my phone when I had no shelter from the rain. It's where I've sat, thinking myself invisible, only for someone to notice, hand me $5, and remind me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but eventually, I became close with someone who lived two houses away and another friend from my street. Although they no longer live here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I can hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the neighbors, and you're generally left in peace unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose during football, but the good times outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy swings and slides. The park now brings a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of food options within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants, although many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for delivery. Fast food is popular, as in most suburbs, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, such as an Indian-owned store for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I really enjoy my neighborhood. Reading about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me appreciate mine even more.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few affordable and enjoyable restaurants and bars. One of the bars recently changed its name and has become pricier, but the service and drinks are still decent. The residents are generally friendly, comprising mostly college students and lower-income individuals, as the apartments are relatively cheap. There's an elementary school nearby, so there are many children around. Although I don't interact with my neighbors, I'm not inclined to either. They smoke a lot of marijuana, prompting management to place an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly insulting. The buildings nearby typically appear old but may have updated interiors. A short distance away, new apartments have been constructed, but I don't favor them due to their poor construction and high rent, which I view as a rip-off justified by their proximity to campus. Close by is a very affordable restaurant that serves food on paper plates and mostly reheats it in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station that reportedly isn’t a great place to work. Recently, the city improved the road, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps, but it's still more wooded than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and more apartments. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street behind it is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and run-down buildings. The abundance of trees there likely serves to conceal the buildings' condition. Most crime in the area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but there are also issues with crime and a transient population in the apartments across from me. Despite this, I like my neighborhood. It's affordable and conveniently located, with the university within walking distance and two bus stops nearby, making trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They are scattered and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow, has white porches, and features green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of an unassigned driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This experience is a refreshing break from the modern world's focus on technology and computers. It feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies and fluffy clouds. The only drawback this season is the tornado warnings. Last night, for the first time, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my bigger dog refused to come into the bathroom, instead staying in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road steamed due to the temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees within minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the warm pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I hurried inside to grab my camera and captured the scene to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was cooking. This neighborhood is very welcoming for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, like everyone else here. Although all the houses look identical on the outside, the apartments differ inside, with some being surprisingly small. It puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home and strolling down to the pond, which is not meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear a large bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like residing in a small village community. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. I was fortunate to discover this delightful neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for around 10 years, I think I can share my experiences. When I first moved to my neighborhood, I was quite sad. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was tough, and I cried because I missed my old friends and loved ones. However, my parents wanted a better environment for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and a nicer high school, far from what we considered \"ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends and some enemies at school. I didn't get to know most of my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family, and Dennis next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value them. I remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyous occasion. I caught the garter, but missed the bouquet! We danced all night, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, although I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I explore it more. I've ventured out with friends Kason and Curtis to play video games and make the most of life. I find peace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and occasionally bring my wooden sword. There's a basketball and tennis court, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, despite the hard work. I've had many enjoyable moments here, and while these are some highlights, I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not be distinctive among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as highlighted on its welcome sign. The area is mainly made up of farmland with peach trees or cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart; most are two-story with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or have gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing for front fields used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where the only stores are found. For \"fast food,\" you can choose between Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There was once a pizzeria, but it closed recently. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's small, pricey grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Despite being the sole grocery store, many residents only buy a few items there, preferring to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. The most popular store is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known community member, which has been in Johnston for many years and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Attached to this store is a pet grooming facility, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. A doctor's office and veterinary practice are located outside the town center; both are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has just one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. Although there are no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide selection of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you might pass through without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but it's a generally quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. Neighbors mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located on the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars people drive around here. We tend to notice unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids ride their bikes as you might expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and me. So, I imagine others are used to seeing us come and go, too. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, which fills the air with a pleasant aroma. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March until around October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees because it was originally a wooded area, providing plenty of shade, but also an abundance of leaves to rake and burn in the fall. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, a nice indicator that fall has arrived. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. During holidays, it's quite peaceful here. Thanksgiving brings some visiting families, and extra cars are parked everywhere, similar to other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is situated right in the heart of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a lawn, you know the owner is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely scattered. It's still largely the same, but there have been many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to resemble a city more and more each day, though I suppose that's a common trend everywhere. While most people here are quite friendly, just like any city, there are good areas and bad ones. I live in a neighborhood surrounded by welcoming elderly folks, so it's probably one of the nicer areas. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you're looking for upscale options, you have to travel a bit; there aren't any Whole Foods or similar stores around. The most common jobs in my city seem to be in construction, though this is just my observation and not based on official statistics. This might be because the city is still underdeveloped, with lots of open land left to build on, which worries me because I like things as they are. I left a big city and have no desire to return. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field—I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here is the variety of wildlife. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert's climate and landscape create challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these non-human neighbors to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, all of whom are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have a few. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun, the Victorville way. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that tell the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, I have a somewhat distinct perspective. Unlike many who might describe their neighborhoods as homeowners with separate lives, my experience is a bit different. I see the college campus where I reside as my neighborhood, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also view the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. It's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area before delving into them. There are three main housing options nearby: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with each floor containing about 4-6 rooms. Most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 residents each. The standalone houses are available for rent by those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni in 2-4 bedroom configurations. These houses are few and scattered, as they are less space-efficient. Lastly, the dormitories, which are the most prevalent, house hundreds of students. Usually, two students share a room, with some exceptions. With housing covered, let's move on to the residents. My school prides itself on diversity, reflected in the cultural and age variety of those living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff reside in the on-campus houses, while newer students stay in dorms and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so let’s discuss the shops and parks. My school functions as a self-sufficient neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's own branded clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, anything needed is accessible within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse residents and is kept clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. My house is perched atop the steepest hill around, which slopes downward. Locals dub it the \"work out hill\" because it's popular with joggers as part of their exercise routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians use the road, which has a few potholes that make driving a bit risky. Some telephone and power lines in the area look ragged due to frequent storms that knock down branches and debris, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere, but residents often cut them down to enhance the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay's scenery. The view is stunning at sunset when the bay glows and the sky turns orange, though it's mostly cloudy, making the sunlight appear through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, with moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. There aren't many children here, despite a nearby school; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often seen in yards or running down the street, sometimes sneaking into open doors or windows. I once found a dog in my living room and had to guide it outside. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in our neighborhood. We also see birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, along with the occasional hawk or eagle, until they are chased off by crows. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and the opposite shore is visible even through the mist most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and is a popular way to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban area, so you'll still feel like you're in the city. As you explore, be ready to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll come across an Asian-owned store nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly common. These businesses are favored by locals because they offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are very convenient. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping very convenient. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Additionally, there's a recently renovated park nearby featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for summer fun. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds enjoying them. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family houses. People here are generally nice but can be quite noisy. You'll often hear cars blasting music or revving their engines as they pass by, which might wake you up. If you visit at night, stay alert. While the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying in the past, and package theft is a recent issue. Although New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, many people here disregard this rule. Every morning, you'll likely spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is seeing dog waste everywhere, so watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is what \"weird\" means. The city's unofficial motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes skirting the law—says \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this serves as a reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a city less famous and costly, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos for them, Portland remains weird. Weirdness here doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what is usually not accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of the nation, most of what we purchase comes from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be unusual, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. The city has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird just means we take everything a bit less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, we have vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes during summer. Free boxes, typically cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items someone no longer wants, often containing a perfect treasure for a passerby. They usually have clothes and books, but can include anything. The enchanting experience of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me—though I'm just one among many types of weird here. Some locals wouldn't dream of choosing clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might attend goat yoga (yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer games. Portland is filled with people who love diverse things and pursue their dreams, or at least dream of doing so while spending excessive time at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which often stems from mental health issues exacerbated by the frequent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, but these are inadequate, much like elsewhere in the country. Residents' attitudes towards the homeless fluctuate between compassion and disdain, making us not so weird in this aspect.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun’s path at every dawn and dusk. Even when I overlook them, distracted by work and life, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand attention, and when I finally notice them, they offer solace to my anxious mind, giving me the strength to continue, one day at a time. I moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus were the first to capture my attention. The university is also filled with stunning sights—buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured my heart—but the mountains reign supreme. The rest of the town has its own beauty. There are numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride downtown reveals an old-world charm with faded colored bricks adorning the restaurants and office buildings, where the town matches the hustle of its neighboring city. This lively atmosphere only spans a few blocks, and soon you can escape back to the quiet small town feel by passing the library. This close contrast of environments gives the city a magical appeal, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories tied to different parts of town. Whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the lively downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university. Yet, like all places, it holds some harsh memories. The ponds are particularly suited for reflection or late-night cries during existential crises, an experience I know well. Watching turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives with purpose makes me question my own as I navigate life’s mysteries. I walked past the pond, through the park, and past suburban homes until I reached a main street. Then, as sunlight streamed over the palm trees and painted the sky, I realized I was heading north. As expected, the mountains were there, towering over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this place—it's a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect people to live, or at least not where most would choose to. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and the hotels occupied mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. Along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls meticulously arranged along the road. The first ones you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory activities, so we'll gloss over those—appearances can be misleading, after all. Yet, the apartments next to them and the two adjacent complexes offer a world almost unknown to the local residents. Across from these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as they start their early mornings. The iron gates creak open for them, while commuters express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road meets another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm air. Children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at teenage girls chatting by the playground about boys and YouTube trends. A sushi restaurant in the strip mall beside the park offers affordable food but rarely sees a crowd. Next to it is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one place—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold cups of yogurt topped with sweets, skateboarding and vaping in the park, thinking it's the coolest thing. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most residences are single-family homes, but some have been divided into two units while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like the majority of homes here, it evokes a time when suburban living was considered the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the nation but is now fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others persist, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were; the upkeep of small yards has declined. However, driveways still hold a car or two, and children play as if their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, inspiring the youth with a sense of future while evoking nostalgia among older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, yet basketball courts remain bustling. Although the homes all look different, they have a similar feel. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the area. Most residents are African American. The streets are wide, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have been here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but with the decline of karate-themed movies, it has been replaced by a pharmacy, suggesting that medication solves problems, or so they say. There's also a small movie theater that screens classic films at reduced prices, unpopular with the youth due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable night out, sans children. An expressway runs through town, though its exit and entrance are located in the neighboring town. A petition once proposed an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by elders who felt it would harm the community. The elders eventually convinced the city council to reject it. A new high school is under construction, and we're deciding on a mascot. I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent our town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where a wide range of businesses operate. These include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is an abundance of new dining options and places to shop. Some shops are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are gaining popularity, too. They can be found in malls and along streets, close to neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the many attractions nearby. There are also a few parks close by, where I've noticed many people take their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's significant diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, there is a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even short distances can mean long drives; traveling 10 miles can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city. Although some attractions are nearby, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging. Despite this, there's been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone lives, or wants to live, in large apartment complexes. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties host single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This diversity in housing is present even in my immediate neighborhood. The community consists of people of all ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community anymore, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the vast, open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home, and she had never encountered so much open space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I shared my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she began to understand who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry, beyond which lies the small community I call home. The houses, primarily made of brick and stucco, each have at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In the spring, flowers are planted in abundance, and the trees reflect the changing seasons characteristic of the Midwest. The driveways are filled with top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz luxury cars, gleaming in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue towards my grey stucco house, you’ll likely see my Korean neighbor outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, singing along over the sound of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he remains sincere and has a fascinating history. Although he has grown older and lost some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, you’ll arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam around, chased by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. Whether building tree forts or 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, there was always an adventure waiting and usually a neighborhood child to share it with. Winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they hold a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a stark wilderness. The trees that once bore vibrant flowers become bare, skeletal structures. Occasionally, when snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would construct large igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, often using branches. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."
