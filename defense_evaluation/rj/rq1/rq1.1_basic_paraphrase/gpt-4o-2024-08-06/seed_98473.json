            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Every destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most beautiful locations, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by water, with stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches where you can dip your toes are everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses aren't packed closely together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some remodeled and some retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street. Many homes feature older aluminum siding, and in the surrounding blocks, houses come in every imaginable color. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America—hardworking people making a living, raising or having raised families. On any day, you'll see children playing in the streets and people walking dogs, cycling, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and it’s easy to tell who belongs. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a smile with someone walking their dog from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, without leaves left over from fall. Green grass is neatly mowed, and plants and bushes are trimmed. While the neighborhood isn't strikingly beautiful, it's a place where you'd think it'd be ideal to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though average in appearance, it is outstanding for being a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff’s department and jail. Next to that is the Health Department. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving local residents. Nearby, there are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is adjacent to these fields, allowing you to hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside resembles a typical suburban setting, characterized by uniformity. In my particular neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, a result of the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each home includes a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads, free of potholes, despite the various families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's focus on uniformity is responsible for this setup. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to exercise; the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mostly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for each other. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population, yet it retains a small-town feel with most amenities available. We have one mall that, while not enormous, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where numerous shopping options await. There are high-end grocery stores offering organic products and discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, featuring nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we aren't immediately adjacent to shopping centers, you can easily drive to any major chain store you need.",
            "The first time I learned about my apartment, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment around here costs over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends end up crying themselves to sleep. Life is pricey, but over time, we've mastered the art of frugality. You begin to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes stored away with mothballs. As adults, we notice odors less. You might take up smoking, or perhaps you're just used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market always makes its presence known. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. This scent clings to leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. Despite the traffic outside, they're quiet. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. They say it's a city on the rise, home to one of the largest online empires in e-commerce and delivery, yet still grappling with growth challenges. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own objectives, and few demand anything from you. You can be solitary, silent, and self-reliant, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude on others' lives. You can maintain your protective shell as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like ocean waves. It's an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, our apartment is less of a place filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and lend a hand when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure I clean up after myself, share food with them, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but it's neighbors like mine who make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban outskirts of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is the most economically challenged area. The property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only experienced minor incidents, such as the occasional theft from our porch when items are left out. The town as a whole has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" prevalent in many parts of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, our town offers ample resources to tackle this crisis, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for loved ones of those affected by addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive features. My son's elementary school has an excellent team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's positive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys attending. The active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family faces discrimination for an inability to pay, and school-related costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements have mainly been centralized in the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a concern for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options, both small businesses and larger stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suitable. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Situated on a hill, it is surrounded by buildings of historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill, there's a charming little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this part of town. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains of mid-winter make staying warm difficult. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, helps keep them warmer. They're also within walking and transit distance of the only family center for miles, where they can wash up. What I cherish about my city isn't just the historical beauty—the towering buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills descending to the ocean. What I truly love about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast. Even now, three decades later, stories circulate about federal and DEA agents sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these tales, passing them down to newcomers like me. Although Hilltop is still considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness. They care deeply about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is an echo of the past, tinged with social conditioning's bitterness. Perhaps it's because I can pass as not completely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own—someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born from ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself on being a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, give me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually grew close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Those friends have since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with numerous two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, you can hear children playing outside, but it's generally quiet during the week. I’ve never had any issues with my neighbors; they leave you alone unless you need assistance. I often order packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I have many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories happened there, too, when I got hit in the nose while playing football, but the positive memories far outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who love the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park fills them with excitement, and it brings a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a mile. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for convenience, though fast food spots remain popular, as they are in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores provide everything you might need, with several dry cleaners and both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, alongside a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop perfect for purchasing ingredients or ready-made Indian meals. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few enjoyable and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently got a new name and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are generally friendly, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, since the apartment rents aren't high. There's an elementary school within walking distance, so there are many children around. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so management installed an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and slightly insulting. The surrounding buildings look old but might have updated interiors. A bit further down the street are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which I consider a scam. There's a cheap restaurant five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Opposite that is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the city-funded road improvements last summer added a nice sidewalk and greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some were cut down, leaving stumps, and there are more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, whereas 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings. The trees there likely conceal the buildings' conditions. Most local crime occurs at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but my street also has crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my living situation. It's affordable, and there are many convenient amenities nearby. I particularly appreciate that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged in a way that makes them resemble individual homes. However, they all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most residents are friends, often gathering at the end of an unspecified driveway in the evenings to chat while the local children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This social atmosphere is refreshing in our technology-driven world and feels like a step back in time. The neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and puffy clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard actual sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room barking. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared as the sun came out during a brief rain shower. I dashed inside to grab my camera and took pictures to share on Facebook, which amazed my friends and family, as it did me. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until people returned home after the storm. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents people have here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors vary in size, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and heading to the nearby pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening as a reminder of its presence. I feel fortunate to have found this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share my experiences. Initially, I was quite upset when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was heartbroken, but my parents wanted better opportunities for me and my sister, like an improved living area and a better high school, in a neighborhood perceived as more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, making new friends and some rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value their presence. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyful occasion. I even caught the garter, although I missed out on the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I especially enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's moved on to great things. The neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I now explore more than before, especially when hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We often played video games and lived life fully. Occasionally, I'd visit the park for some nature therapy, which brings me peace. I also practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken wooden sword. Although I haven't played basketball or tennis lately, it's nice to know the courts are there. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable moments here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that might not distinguish itself from others in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact displayed on the town's welcome sign. The area is predominantly farmland, featuring peach trees and cattle. Houses outside the town's center are spaced far apart, mostly two-story buildings with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing the front land to be used for livestock or crops. In the town's center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection where the few local stores are found. You can grab \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's only grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is small and pricey. Many residents prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-loved local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and provides delivery services with two movers. Attached to the furniture store is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There's a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice outside the main town area, both well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston has just one elementary school, and students must go to the next town for middle and high school. Although there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to offer more family-friendly activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide range of restaurants, Johnston remains a pleasant town that can be missed in the blink of an eye.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but despite that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's not much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people living here. Residents often engage in yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars that locals drive. When we notice an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to keep an eye on it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out, and kids play on bikes, as you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from there. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. This means the neighborhood is also accustomed to our comings and goings. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. There's almost always someone mowing the lawn here, with the sound of lawnmowers audible nearly every day from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing plenty of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Since our garage is at the back of our house, we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's similar for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood lies right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to really grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a green lawn, it's clear that person is spending a fortune on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that hasn't changed much, there's been a lot of new development. Honestly, this place is beginning to resemble a city more and more each day, but I suppose that’s a trend happening everywhere. Generally, the people are quite friendly, though like any city, there are both good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I’m surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores around here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you’re looking for upscale shopping, you have to travel a bit further; I rarely see Whole Foods or similar stores. The jobs that seem most common in my city, without relying on official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because the city is still not fully developed, with lots of open spaces available for building. That prospect unnerves me since I like things the way they are now. I left a large city and I'm not eager to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in this field as I install drywall and T-bar. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for numerous reasons, one of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert’s climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about the wildlife inhabiting this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Moreover, Victorville is a great place for families to explore the desert, offering unique experiences. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair, which will enhance your visit with a mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons to complete your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that narrate the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also consider the greater campus area as my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that form my neighborhood. Before diving into the houses, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room typically accommodates 2-4 people, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common buildings have around 2 floors, hosting about 20 people each. Second, there are the actual houses that anyone connected to the school can rent. These usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the standard dorm rooms which house hundreds of students, with two sharing a room, generally speaking. This is the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, reflected in my neighborhood's demographic. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most of the professional staff live in the houses within the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. It’s hard to fully capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood through mere words, so let’s move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers numerous shops and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, alongside the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. The terrain slopes downward, and my home is perched at the top of the steepest hill nearby. Locals nickname it the \"work out hill\" since many joggers choose it for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which is pothole-ridden and somewhat risky for driving. The telephone and power lines in the neighborhood appear worn and patched up. Frequent storms and rainfall cause branches and debris to often damage the lines, leading to repeated repairs that give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are abundant, but residents dislike them because they block the ocean view. Consequently, many homes are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The area is breathtaking at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's mostly cloudy, with the sun often seen through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, and moss thrives on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and it became covered in moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in the vicinity, despite a nearby school. Most residents are older and retired, preferring dogs over children. It's typical to see dogs lounging on lawns or playing in the street. Leaving a door or window open can result in dogs entering your home; I once found one in my living room. Rabbits are plentiful and roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay, as they damage plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in the neighborhood. We also see various birds, from sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks or eagles appear until crows drive them away. There are no stores nearby, but a downhill walk to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be challenging! Public transportation is highly accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a predominantly urban area, so you'll still feel the vibrant atmosphere of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit, as the neighborhood has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. You'll come across at least one Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are favored by locals for their excellent food quality, lower prices, and convenience. In my vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of shopping for groceries. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely inhabited by Asian residents; it's a diverse community with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. While many of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a newly renovated park nearby featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given we're in New York City, the park is naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. In Bensonhurst, you won't find many large corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op or condominium apartment buildings, with most housing being two-family homes. The residents are generally friendly but quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or speeding by, which may wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise caution. Although the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault here years ago, and package theft is a recent issue. Despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, the rule isn't always followed here. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest frustration is the prevalence of dog waste throughout the neighborhood. Be mindful to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is all about, you must first understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes bending the rules—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was more obscure, affordable, and a breeding ground for creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos built for them, Portland retains its quirks. Being weird here doesn't necessarily mean being universally accepting, but it does imply embracing what is typically not accepted. It doesn’t mean the absence of modern conveniences or struggles; like other places, Portland buys most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy the norm, yet Portland is also quite ordinary, with yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird here means not taking things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many around Portland, you’ll find vibrant houses, gardens lining the streets with flowers and produce, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs, often containing something serendipitously fitting for a passerby. They usually hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. This enchanting possibility of discovery defines Portland for me, though I am just one of countless expressions of weird. Some locals would never consider picking clothes out of a sidewalk box; they might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is home to people with diverse passions, who chase their dreams—or dream of doing so, while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, there’s a drug issue, often linked to mental health challenges, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also faces a homelessness crisis, with few solutions in sight. The homeless community is drawn by the city’s relatively better social services, which remain inadequate, as is the case nationwide. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast. In the north, they silently observe the sun's passage at each dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become preoccupied with the busyness of work and life, they remain, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress overwhelms me, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, granting me the strength to persevere, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate years, and it was the northern mountains near the campus that initially captivated me. Certainly, the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, but it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way. There are numerous cafés where many caffeine-fueled study sessions took place. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area immerses you in an old-world charm with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals as much energy and activity as its neighboring urban city. However, this liveliness only spans a few blocks, after which you can retreat once more to the tranquil small-town feel by passing the library. This close proximity of contrasting atmospheres gives the city an enchanting vibe, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-night study session or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the elegant theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it also holds its share of painful memories, as all places inevitably do in life. The ponds, for instance, can be an ideal spot for reflection or for tearful moments at two in the morning during an existential crisis—something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I struggled to navigate the enigma of life. So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its radiant light atop the palm trees, painting the sky in its wake, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they rekindled my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip isn’t typically where you’d expect to find homes. Certainly not desirable ones. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue around the hotels that fill up only during the summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets are several apartment complexes, lined up meticulously like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged side by side. The first set of apartments has been in the news for some less-than-flattering reasons, so let’s not dwell on them—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the adjacent complexes offer a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet cluster of buildings where students trickle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. as they start their day. The gates open slowly to let them in, while drivers nearby express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road extends into another residential street, flanked by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a leisurely spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees drift among the flowers nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the young girls gathered by the playground, chattering about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Next to the park, there’s a sushi restaurant in a strip mall with affordable food that rarely seems crowded. A swimming supply store and a nail salon are nearby, allowing you to prep your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and some hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens frequently hang out, holding their chilled cups heaped with toppings as they perform skateboard tricks and vape, thinking it’s the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of American life—a piece of history in the unchanging, tranquil South.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but a few have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes any sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to encompass the people of this nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors to believe the dream is alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as before, the maintenance of small yards has waned, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, nurturing a future in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but basketball courts are bustling. Although each home looks different, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket named Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family here, while the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy—because, apparently, drugs solve everything, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater showing old films at reduced prices, avoided by the youth who dislike its lack of new releases but appreciated by elders who find it a small price for a night out, sans kids. An expressway runs through my town, though the exit and entrance lie in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the youth supported it, but the elders opposed it, claiming an expressway exit would spoil the town. Their persuasion led the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being constructed, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed, seemingly at random, with commercial zones where a wide array of businesses operate. These businesses include offices, various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of new dining options and shops to explore. While some stores belong to large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods, made lively by nearby attractions. There are a couple of parks nearby, which are popular spots for families with young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse, featuring a significant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are even more people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk in the city, as it is vast, and most prefer not to travel on foot. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and parking can be challenging to find anywhere. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Despite this, there is a variety of housing options, not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of various ages, and honestly, I'm not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the neighborhood who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is all there is!\" I responded, aware that the vast openness would surprise her. She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was just a short five-minute walk from her home—she had never experienced such expansive space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a narrow country road, you will come across a quarry filled with water, and just beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, there is an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. The driveways boast high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that sparkle in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue toward my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing his lawn, singing above the sound of his mower. He is the source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely a wonderful person with an interesting history. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower as he has aged and lost some of his sharpness. Eventually, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese abound, pursued by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water, and an occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals—mostly just chasing them—there was always something to do, often with a neighborhood friend. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they possess a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blooms become skeletal structures of bark. When snow occasionally falls, it transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels crafted by my little sister, along with snowmen. As kids, my sister and I often argued, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We built large igloo-like forts to store our 'ammunition,' using branches like an arsenal. In this little wonderland, we played pretend, at a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Every destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most beautiful locations, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by water, with stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches where you can dip your toes are everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses aren't packed closely together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some remodeled and some retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street. Many homes feature older aluminum siding, and in the surrounding blocks, houses come in every imaginable color. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America—hardworking people making a living, raising or having raised families. On any day, you'll see children playing in the streets and people walking dogs, cycling, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and it’s easy to tell who belongs. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a smile with someone walking their dog from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, without leaves left over from fall. Green grass is neatly mowed, and plants and bushes are trimmed. While the neighborhood isn't strikingly beautiful, it's a place where you'd think it'd be ideal to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though average in appearance, it is outstanding for being a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff’s department and jail. Next to that is the Health Department. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving local residents. Nearby, there are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is adjacent to these fields, allowing you to hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside resembles a typical suburban setting, characterized by uniformity. In my particular neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, a result of the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each home includes a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads, free of potholes, despite the various families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's focus on uniformity is responsible for this setup. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to exercise; the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mostly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for each other. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population, yet it retains a small-town feel with most amenities available. We have one mall that, while not enormous, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where numerous shopping options await. There are high-end grocery stores offering organic products and discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, featuring nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we aren't immediately adjacent to shopping centers, you can easily drive to any major chain store you need.",
            "The first time I learned about my apartment, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment around here costs over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends end up crying themselves to sleep. Life is pricey, but over time, we've mastered the art of frugality. You begin to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes stored away with mothballs. As adults, we notice odors less. You might take up smoking, or perhaps you're just used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market always makes its presence known. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. This scent clings to leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. Despite the traffic outside, they're quiet. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. They say it's a city on the rise, home to one of the largest online empires in e-commerce and delivery, yet still grappling with growth challenges. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own objectives, and few demand anything from you. You can be solitary, silent, and self-reliant, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude on others' lives. You can maintain your protective shell as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like ocean waves. It's an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, our apartment is less of a place filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and lend a hand when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure I clean up after myself, share food with them, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but it's neighbors like mine who make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban outskirts of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is the most economically challenged area. The property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only experienced minor incidents, such as the occasional theft from our porch when items are left out. The town as a whole has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" prevalent in many parts of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, our town offers ample resources to tackle this crisis, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for loved ones of those affected by addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive features. My son's elementary school has an excellent team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's positive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys attending. The active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family faces discrimination for an inability to pay, and school-related costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements have mainly been centralized in the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a concern for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options, both small businesses and larger stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suitable. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Situated on a hill, it is surrounded by buildings of historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill, there's a charming little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this part of town. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains of mid-winter make staying warm difficult. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, helps keep them warmer. They're also within walking and transit distance of the only family center for miles, where they can wash up. What I cherish about my city isn't just the historical beauty—the towering buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills descending to the ocean. What I truly love about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast. Even now, three decades later, stories circulate about federal and DEA agents sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these tales, passing them down to newcomers like me. Although Hilltop is still considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness. They care deeply about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is an echo of the past, tinged with social conditioning's bitterness. Perhaps it's because I can pass as not completely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own—someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born from ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself on being a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, give me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually grew close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Those friends have since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with numerous two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, you can hear children playing outside, but it's generally quiet during the week. I’ve never had any issues with my neighbors; they leave you alone unless you need assistance. I often order packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I have many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories happened there, too, when I got hit in the nose while playing football, but the positive memories far outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who love the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park fills them with excitement, and it brings a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a mile. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for convenience, though fast food spots remain popular, as they are in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores provide everything you might need, with several dry cleaners and both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, alongside a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop perfect for purchasing ingredients or ready-made Indian meals. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few enjoyable and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently got a new name and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are generally friendly, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, since the apartment rents aren't high. There's an elementary school within walking distance, so there are many children around. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so management installed an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and slightly insulting. The surrounding buildings look old but might have updated interiors. A bit further down the street are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which I consider a scam. There's a cheap restaurant five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Opposite that is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the city-funded road improvements last summer added a nice sidewalk and greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some were cut down, leaving stumps, and there are more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, whereas 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings. The trees there likely conceal the buildings' conditions. Most local crime occurs at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but my street also has crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my living situation. It's affordable, and there are many convenient amenities nearby. I particularly appreciate that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged in a way that makes them resemble individual homes. However, they all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most residents are friends, often gathering at the end of an unspecified driveway in the evenings to chat while the local children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This social atmosphere is refreshing in our technology-driven world and feels like a step back in time. The neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and puffy clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard actual sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room barking. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared as the sun came out during a brief rain shower. I dashed inside to grab my camera and took pictures to share on Facebook, which amazed my friends and family, as it did me. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until people returned home after the storm. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents people have here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors vary in size, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and heading to the nearby pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening as a reminder of its presence. I feel fortunate to have found this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share my experiences. Initially, I was quite upset when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was heartbroken, but my parents wanted better opportunities for me and my sister, like an improved living area and a better high school, in a neighborhood perceived as more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, making new friends and some rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value their presence. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyful occasion. I even caught the garter, although I missed out on the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I especially enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's moved on to great things. The neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I now explore more than before, especially when hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We often played video games and lived life fully. Occasionally, I'd visit the park for some nature therapy, which brings me peace. I also practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken wooden sword. Although I haven't played basketball or tennis lately, it's nice to know the courts are there. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable moments here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that might not distinguish itself from others in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact displayed on the town's welcome sign. The area is predominantly farmland, featuring peach trees and cattle. Houses outside the town's center are spaced far apart, mostly two-story buildings with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing the front land to be used for livestock or crops. In the town's center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection where the few local stores are found. You can grab \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's only grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is small and pricey. Many residents prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-loved local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and provides delivery services with two movers. Attached to the furniture store is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There's a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice outside the main town area, both well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston has just one elementary school, and students must go to the next town for middle and high school. Although there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to offer more family-friendly activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide range of restaurants, Johnston remains a pleasant town that can be missed in the blink of an eye.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but despite that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's not much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people living here. Residents often engage in yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars that locals drive. When we notice an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to keep an eye on it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out, and kids play on bikes, as you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from there. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. This means the neighborhood is also accustomed to our comings and goings. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. There's almost always someone mowing the lawn here, with the sound of lawnmowers audible nearly every day from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing plenty of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Since our garage is at the back of our house, we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's similar for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood lies right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to really grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a green lawn, it's clear that person is spending a fortune on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that hasn't changed much, there's been a lot of new development. Honestly, this place is beginning to resemble a city more and more each day, but I suppose that’s a trend happening everywhere. Generally, the people are quite friendly, though like any city, there are both good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I’m surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores around here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you’re looking for upscale shopping, you have to travel a bit further; I rarely see Whole Foods or similar stores. The jobs that seem most common in my city, without relying on official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because the city is still not fully developed, with lots of open spaces available for building. That prospect unnerves me since I like things the way they are now. I left a large city and I'm not eager to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in this field as I install drywall and T-bar. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for numerous reasons, one of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert’s climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about the wildlife inhabiting this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Moreover, Victorville is a great place for families to explore the desert, offering unique experiences. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair, which will enhance your visit with a mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons to complete your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that narrate the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also consider the greater campus area as my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that form my neighborhood. Before diving into the houses, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room typically accommodates 2-4 people, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common buildings have around 2 floors, hosting about 20 people each. Second, there are the actual houses that anyone connected to the school can rent. These usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the standard dorm rooms which house hundreds of students, with two sharing a room, generally speaking. This is the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, reflected in my neighborhood's demographic. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most of the professional staff live in the houses within the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. It’s hard to fully capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood through mere words, so let’s move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers numerous shops and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, alongside the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. The terrain slopes downward, and my home is perched at the top of the steepest hill nearby. Locals nickname it the \"work out hill\" since many joggers choose it for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which is pothole-ridden and somewhat risky for driving. The telephone and power lines in the neighborhood appear worn and patched up. Frequent storms and rainfall cause branches and debris to often damage the lines, leading to repeated repairs that give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are abundant, but residents dislike them because they block the ocean view. Consequently, many homes are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The area is breathtaking at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's mostly cloudy, with the sun often seen through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, and moss thrives on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and it became covered in moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in the vicinity, despite a nearby school. Most residents are older and retired, preferring dogs over children. It's typical to see dogs lounging on lawns or playing in the street. Leaving a door or window open can result in dogs entering your home; I once found one in my living room. Rabbits are plentiful and roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay, as they damage plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in the neighborhood. We also see various birds, from sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks or eagles appear until crows drive them away. There are no stores nearby, but a downhill walk to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be challenging! Public transportation is highly accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a predominantly urban area, so you'll still feel the vibrant atmosphere of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit, as the neighborhood has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. You'll come across at least one Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are favored by locals for their excellent food quality, lower prices, and convenience. In my vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of shopping for groceries. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely inhabited by Asian residents; it's a diverse community with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. While many of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a newly renovated park nearby featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given we're in New York City, the park is naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. In Bensonhurst, you won't find many large corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op or condominium apartment buildings, with most housing being two-family homes. The residents are generally friendly but quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or speeding by, which may wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise caution. Although the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault here years ago, and package theft is a recent issue. Despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, the rule isn't always followed here. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest frustration is the prevalence of dog waste throughout the neighborhood. Be mindful to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is all about, you must first understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes bending the rules—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was more obscure, affordable, and a breeding ground for creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos built for them, Portland retains its quirks. Being weird here doesn't necessarily mean being universally accepting, but it does imply embracing what is typically not accepted. It doesn’t mean the absence of modern conveniences or struggles; like other places, Portland buys most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy the norm, yet Portland is also quite ordinary, with yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird here means not taking things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many around Portland, you’ll find vibrant houses, gardens lining the streets with flowers and produce, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs, often containing something serendipitously fitting for a passerby. They usually hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. This enchanting possibility of discovery defines Portland for me, though I am just one of countless expressions of weird. Some locals would never consider picking clothes out of a sidewalk box; they might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is home to people with diverse passions, who chase their dreams—or dream of doing so, while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, there’s a drug issue, often linked to mental health challenges, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also faces a homelessness crisis, with few solutions in sight. The homeless community is drawn by the city’s relatively better social services, which remain inadequate, as is the case nationwide. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast. In the north, they silently observe the sun's passage at each dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become preoccupied with the busyness of work and life, they remain, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress overwhelms me, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, granting me the strength to persevere, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate years, and it was the northern mountains near the campus that initially captivated me. Certainly, the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, but it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way. There are numerous cafés where many caffeine-fueled study sessions took place. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area immerses you in an old-world charm with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals as much energy and activity as its neighboring urban city. However, this liveliness only spans a few blocks, after which you can retreat once more to the tranquil small-town feel by passing the library. This close proximity of contrasting atmospheres gives the city an enchanting vibe, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-night study session or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the elegant theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it also holds its share of painful memories, as all places inevitably do in life. The ponds, for instance, can be an ideal spot for reflection or for tearful moments at two in the morning during an existential crisis—something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I struggled to navigate the enigma of life. So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its radiant light atop the palm trees, painting the sky in its wake, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they rekindled my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip isn’t typically where you’d expect to find homes. Certainly not desirable ones. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue around the hotels that fill up only during the summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets are several apartment complexes, lined up meticulously like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged side by side. The first set of apartments has been in the news for some less-than-flattering reasons, so let’s not dwell on them—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the adjacent complexes offer a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet cluster of buildings where students trickle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. as they start their day. The gates open slowly to let them in, while drivers nearby express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road extends into another residential street, flanked by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a leisurely spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees drift among the flowers nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the young girls gathered by the playground, chattering about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Next to the park, there’s a sushi restaurant in a strip mall with affordable food that rarely seems crowded. A swimming supply store and a nail salon are nearby, allowing you to prep your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and some hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens frequently hang out, holding their chilled cups heaped with toppings as they perform skateboard tricks and vape, thinking it’s the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of American life—a piece of history in the unchanging, tranquil South.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but a few have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes any sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to encompass the people of this nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors to believe the dream is alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as before, the maintenance of small yards has waned, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, nurturing a future in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but basketball courts are bustling. Although each home looks different, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket named Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family here, while the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy—because, apparently, drugs solve everything, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater showing old films at reduced prices, avoided by the youth who dislike its lack of new releases but appreciated by elders who find it a small price for a night out, sans kids. An expressway runs through my town, though the exit and entrance lie in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the youth supported it, but the elders opposed it, claiming an expressway exit would spoil the town. Their persuasion led the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being constructed, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed, seemingly at random, with commercial zones where a wide array of businesses operate. These businesses include offices, various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of new dining options and shops to explore. While some stores belong to large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods, made lively by nearby attractions. There are a couple of parks nearby, which are popular spots for families with young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse, featuring a significant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are even more people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk in the city, as it is vast, and most prefer not to travel on foot. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and parking can be challenging to find anywhere. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Despite this, there is a variety of housing options, not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of various ages, and honestly, I'm not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the neighborhood who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is all there is!\" I responded, aware that the vast openness would surprise her. She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was just a short five-minute walk from her home—she had never experienced such expansive space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a narrow country road, you will come across a quarry filled with water, and just beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, there is an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. The driveways boast high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that sparkle in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue toward my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing his lawn, singing above the sound of his mower. He is the source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely a wonderful person with an interesting history. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower as he has aged and lost some of his sharpness. Eventually, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese abound, pursued by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water, and an occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals—mostly just chasing them—there was always something to do, often with a neighborhood friend. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they possess a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blooms become skeletal structures of bark. When snow occasionally falls, it transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels crafted by my little sister, along with snowmen. As kids, my sister and I often argued, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We built large igloo-like forts to store our 'ammunition,' using branches like an arsenal. In this little wonderland, we played pretend, at a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Every destination requires a drive. Despite this, I live in one of the world's most beautiful locations, surrounded by water. My town is bordered by water, with stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches where you can dip your toes are everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. Houses aren't packed closely together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some remodeled and some retaining their original charm. Most have full basements visible from the street. Many homes feature older aluminum siding, and in the surrounding blocks, houses come in every imaginable color. Most homes have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America—hardworking people making a living, raising or having raised families. On any day, you'll see children playing in the streets and people walking dogs, cycling, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and it’s easy to tell who belongs. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a smile with someone walking their dog from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, without leaves left over from fall. Green grass is neatly mowed, and plants and bushes are trimmed. While the neighborhood isn't strikingly beautiful, it's a place where you'd think it'd be ideal to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though average in appearance, it is outstanding for being a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff’s department and jail. Next to that is the Health Department. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving local residents. Nearby, there are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Our small town airport is adjacent to these fields, allowing you to hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing, whether you're inside or outside. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside resembles a typical suburban setting, characterized by uniformity. In my particular neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, a result of the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each home includes a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads, free of potholes, despite the various families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are two larger lockers for packages. The HOA's focus on uniformity is responsible for this setup. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood is a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various amenities. There are multiple community pools accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park to exercise; the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mostly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for each other. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large in population, yet it retains a small-town feel with most amenities available. We have one mall that, while not enormous, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where numerous shopping options await. There are high-end grocery stores offering organic products and discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, featuring nice amenities like pools and walking trails. Although we aren't immediately adjacent to shopping centers, you can easily drive to any major chain store you need.",
            "The first time I learned about my apartment, I was listening to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment around here costs over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had ever heard that story before. Maybe it's the struggle. Some of my friends end up crying themselves to sleep. Life is pricey, but over time, we've mastered the art of frugality. You begin to appreciate the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes stored away with mothballs. As adults, we notice odors less. You might take up smoking, or perhaps you're just used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market always makes its presence known. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. This scent clings to leather, even after washing. There are three thrift stores within walking distance here. Starting at one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. Despite the traffic outside, they're quiet. It's a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. They say it's a city on the rise, home to one of the largest online empires in e-commerce and delivery, yet still grappling with growth challenges. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own objectives, and few demand anything from you. You can be solitary, silent, and self-reliant, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude on others' lives. You can maintain your protective shell as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like ocean waves. It's an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, our apartment is less of a place filled with strangers and more of a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and lend a hand when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I ensure I clean up after myself, share food with them, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and enjoy each other's company. I live in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but it's neighbors like mine who make me feel I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, just beyond the suburban outskirts of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is the most economically challenged area. The property values are low, with many homes rented or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only experienced minor incidents, such as the occasional theft from our porch when items are left out. The town as a whole has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" prevalent in many parts of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, our town offers ample resources to tackle this crisis, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for loved ones of those affected by addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive features. My son's elementary school has an excellent team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's positive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys attending. The active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family faces discrimination for an inability to pay, and school-related costs for fees, supplies, and field trips are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made several enhancements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements have mainly been centralized in the town's center and west side, where shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated, leaving the east side, where I live, somewhat overlooked, which is a concern for my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options, both small businesses and larger stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suitable. We have lived here for over 16 years and cannot envision living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Situated on a hill, it is surrounded by buildings of historical significance. I reside in a 7-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill, there's a charming little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, you often see a line of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this part of town. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. In the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in tidy rows along the sidewalk and steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains of mid-winter make staying warm difficult. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, helps keep them warmer. They're also within walking and transit distance of the only family center for miles, where they can wash up. What I cherish about my city isn't just the historical beauty—the towering buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills descending to the ocean. What I truly love about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast. Even now, three decades later, stories circulate about federal and DEA agents sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these tales, passing them down to newcomers like me. Although Hilltop is still considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness. They care deeply about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is an echo of the past, tinged with social conditioning's bitterness. Perhaps it's because I can pass as not completely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own—someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born from ignorance and fear, even in a city that prides itself on being a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, give me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually grew close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Those friends have since moved away, but the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with numerous two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, you can hear children playing outside, but it's generally quiet during the week. I’ve never had any issues with my neighbors; they leave you alone unless you need assistance. I often order packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch, which makes me feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I have many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories happened there, too, when I got hit in the nose while playing football, but the positive memories far outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin’s kids, who love the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park fills them with excitement, and it brings a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a mile. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for convenience, though fast food spots remain popular, as they are in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores provide everything you might need, with several dry cleaners and both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, alongside a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop perfect for purchasing ingredients or ready-made Indian meals. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and in the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, along with a few enjoyable and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently got a new name and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The people here are generally friendly, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, since the apartment rents aren't high. There's an elementary school within walking distance, so there are many children around. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so management installed an air freshener outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and slightly insulting. The surrounding buildings look old but might have updated interiors. A bit further down the street are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which I consider a scam. There's a cheap restaurant five minutes away that uses paper plates and microwaves most of its food. Opposite that is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the city-funded road improvements last summer added a nice sidewalk and greenery, enhancing the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some were cut down, leaving stumps, and there are more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line and more apartments. I live on 42nd Street, whereas 43rd Street behind me isn't as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings. The trees there likely conceal the buildings' conditions. Most local crime occurs at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but my street also has crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my living situation. It's affordable, and there are many convenient amenities nearby. I particularly appreciate that the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged in a way that makes them resemble individual homes. However, they all share the same yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Most residents are friends, often gathering at the end of an unspecified driveway in the evenings to chat while the local children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This social atmosphere is refreshing in our technology-driven world and feels like a step back in time. The neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and puffy clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard actual sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I ended up in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room barking. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared as the sun came out during a brief rain shower. I dashed inside to grab my camera and took pictures to share on Facebook, which amazed my friends and family, as it did me. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until people returned home after the storm. Soon, it was back to normal, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents people have here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors vary in size, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and heading to the nearby pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening as a reminder of its presence. I feel fortunate to have found this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share my experiences. Initially, I was quite upset when we moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old friends and was heartbroken, but my parents wanted better opportunities for me and my sister, like an improved living area and a better high school, in a neighborhood perceived as more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, making new friends and some rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family to me, and I truly value their presence. I fondly remember attending Mr. Glen's wedding with my family, which was a joyful occasion. I even caught the garter, although I missed out on the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I especially enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's moved on to great things. The neighborhood is a bit of a maze, but with GPS, I now explore more than before, especially when hanging out with friends like Kason and Curtis. We often played video games and lived life fully. Occasionally, I'd visit the park for some nature therapy, which brings me peace. I also practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and my bokken wooden sword. Although I haven't played basketball or tennis lately, it's nice to know the courts are there. My dad used to coach me and my best friend in tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable moments here, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that might not distinguish itself from others in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact displayed on the town's welcome sign. The area is predominantly farmland, featuring peach trees and cattle. Houses outside the town's center are spaced far apart, mostly two-story buildings with metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, allowing the front land to be used for livestock or crops. In the town's center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection where the few local stores are found. You can grab \"fast food\" at three places: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. There was a pizzeria, but it closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's only grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is small and pricey. Many residents prefer to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. Dollar General is the most popular store, offering a wide range of everyday items and staying busy from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a small furniture store run by a well-loved local woman. It has been in Johnston for many years and provides delivery services with two movers. Attached to the furniture store is a pet grooming service called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. There's a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice outside the main town area, both well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston has just one elementary school, and students must go to the next town for middle and high school. Although there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is under development to offer more family-friendly activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide range of restaurants, Johnston remains a pleasant town that can be missed in the blink of an eye.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern Tennessee town. Our street connects two state highways, which brings more traffic than I'd prefer, but despite that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. There's not much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people living here. Residents often engage in yard work and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, allowing us to observe everyone coming and going, and we recognize the cars that locals drive. When we notice an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to keep an eye on it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to take their dogs out, and kids play on bikes, as you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from there. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. This means the neighborhood is also accustomed to our comings and goings. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. There's almost always someone mowing the lawn here, with the sound of lawnmowers audible nearly every day from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing plenty of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, which signals the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended fall. Since our garage is at the back of our house, we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, it makes me feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's similar for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood lies right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to really grasp what it's like to constantly see brown everywhere, and when you spot a green lawn, it's clear that person is spending a fortune on its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that hasn't changed much, there's been a lot of new development. Honestly, this place is beginning to resemble a city more and more each day, but I suppose that’s a trend happening everywhere. Generally, the people are quite friendly, though like any city, there are both good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I’m surrounded by friendly older folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores around here are mostly chain stores, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you’re looking for upscale shopping, you have to travel a bit further; I rarely see Whole Foods or similar stores. The jobs that seem most common in my city, without relying on official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because the city is still not fully developed, with lots of open spaces available for building. That prospect unnerves me since I like things the way they are now. I left a large city and I'm not eager to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in this field as I install drywall and T-bar. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for numerous reasons, one of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert’s climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about the wildlife inhabiting this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Moreover, Victorville is a great place for families to explore the desert, offering unique experiences. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair, which will enhance your visit with a mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons to complete your trip. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that narrate the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unconventional. Unlike others who might be homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with my dormitory mates forming my community. I also consider the greater campus area as my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares some similarities with traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has houses, people, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that form my neighborhood. Before diving into the houses, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, each room typically accommodates 2-4 people, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common buildings have around 2 floors, hosting about 20 people each. Second, there are the actual houses that anyone connected to the school can rent. These usually have 2-4 bedrooms and are often occupied by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the standard dorm rooms which house hundreds of students, with two sharing a room, generally speaking. This is the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, reflected in my neighborhood's demographic. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most of the professional staff live in the houses within the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitories, and older students live in apartments. It’s hard to fully capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood through mere words, so let’s move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers numerous shops and a single park. The stores include dining options typical of any neighborhood, alongside the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. Therefore, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. The terrain slopes downward, and my home is perched at the top of the steepest hill nearby. Locals nickname it the \"work out hill\" since many joggers choose it for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians walk on the road, which is pothole-ridden and somewhat risky for driving. The telephone and power lines in the neighborhood appear worn and patched up. Frequent storms and rainfall cause branches and debris to often damage the lines, leading to repeated repairs that give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are abundant, but residents dislike them because they block the ocean view. Consequently, many homes are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The area is breathtaking at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's mostly cloudy, with the sun often seen through a haze. Overcast and damp days are common, and moss thrives on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and it became covered in moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in the vicinity, despite a nearby school. Most residents are older and retired, preferring dogs over children. It's typical to see dogs lounging on lawns or playing in the street. Leaving a door or window open can result in dogs entering your home; I once found one in my living room. Rabbits are plentiful and roam freely, much to the gardeners' dismay, as they damage plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers in the neighborhood. We also see various birds, from sparrows to hummingbirds, and occasionally hawks or eagles appear until crows drive them away. There are no stores nearby, but a downhill walk to the waterfront leads to a few seafood restaurants. The beach is minimal, but the rocks are fun to toss into the water. The bay is narrow, and the opposite shore is visible, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be challenging! Public transportation is highly accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is a predominantly urban area, so you'll still feel the vibrant atmosphere of New York City. Expect to see numerous Asian stores during your visit, as the neighborhood has experienced a significant influx of Asian residents over the past two decades. You'll come across at least one Asian-owned store on nearly every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are favored by locals for their excellent food quality, lower prices, and convenience. In my vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of shopping for groceries. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely inhabited by Asian residents; it's a diverse community with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. While many of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned, there's also a newly renovated park nearby featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given we're in New York City, the park is naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. In Bensonhurst, you won't find many large corporate buildings. Instead, you'll see co-op or condominium apartment buildings, with most housing being two-family homes. The residents are generally friendly but quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or speeding by, which may wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise caution. Although the neighborhood is relatively safe, people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault here years ago, and package theft is a recent issue. Despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, the rule isn't always followed here. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest frustration is the prevalence of dog waste throughout the neighborhood. Be mindful to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is all about, you must first understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes bending the rules—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was more obscure, affordable, and a breeding ground for creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos built for them, Portland retains its quirks. Being weird here doesn't necessarily mean being universally accepting, but it does imply embracing what is typically not accepted. It doesn’t mean the absence of modern conveniences or struggles; like other places, Portland buys most of its goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy the norm, yet Portland is also quite ordinary, with yoga studios, hipsters, and business professionals. Maybe being weird here means not taking things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many around Portland, you’ll find vibrant houses, gardens lining the streets with flowers and produce, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs, often containing something serendipitously fitting for a passerby. They usually hold clothes and books, but can contain anything. This enchanting possibility of discovery defines Portland for me, though I am just one of countless expressions of weird. Some locals would never consider picking clothes out of a sidewalk box; they might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is home to people with diverse passions, who chase their dreams—or dream of doing so, while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, there’s a drug issue, often linked to mental health challenges, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also faces a homelessness crisis, with few solutions in sight. The homeless community is drawn by the city’s relatively better social services, which remain inadequate, as is the case nationwide. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast. In the north, they silently observe the sun's passage at each dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become preoccupied with the busyness of work and life, they remain, unyielding and unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress overwhelms me, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, granting me the strength to persevere, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate years, and it was the northern mountains near the campus that initially captivated me. Certainly, the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, but it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way. There are numerous cafés where many caffeine-fueled study sessions took place. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area immerses you in an old-world charm with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals as much energy and activity as its neighboring urban city. However, this liveliness only spans a few blocks, after which you can retreat once more to the tranquil small-town feel by passing the library. This close proximity of contrasting atmospheres gives the city an enchanting vibe, inviting exploration. This makes it easy to create cherished memories, each tied to a specific part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-night study session or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie at the elegant theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it also holds its share of painful memories, as all places inevitably do in life. The ponds, for instance, can be an ideal spot for reflection or for tearful moments at two in the morning during an existential crisis—something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own purpose as I struggled to navigate the enigma of life. So, I walked past the pond, the park, and the quaint suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its radiant light atop the palm trees, painting the sky in its wake, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they rekindled my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip isn’t typically where you’d expect to find homes. Certainly not desirable ones. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue around the hotels that fill up only during the summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets are several apartment complexes, lined up meticulously like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged side by side. The first set of apartments has been in the news for some less-than-flattering reasons, so let’s not dwell on them—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the adjacent complexes offer a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these apartments is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet cluster of buildings where students trickle in with coffee, yawning at 7 a.m. as they start their day. The gates open slowly to let them in, while drivers nearby express frustration at the traffic delays on busier days. The road extends into another residential street, flanked by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a leisurely spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees drift among the flowers nearby. Retirees walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the young girls gathered by the playground, chattering about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Next to the park, there’s a sushi restaurant in a strip mall with affordable food that rarely seems crowded. A swimming supply store and a nail salon are nearby, allowing you to prep your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and some hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop where teens frequently hang out, holding their chilled cups heaped with toppings as they perform skateboard tricks and vape, thinking it’s the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of American life—a piece of history in the unchanging, tranquil South.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but a few have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes any sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to its left. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to encompass the people of this nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors to believe the dream is alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People aren't as optimistic as before, the maintenance of small yards has waned, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, almost 90 years old, still stands, nurturing a future in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but basketball courts are bustling. Although each home looks different, they share a similar feel. A large supermarket named Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family here, while the majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest, and it's now a pharmacy—because, apparently, drugs solve everything, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater showing old films at reduced prices, avoided by the youth who dislike its lack of new releases but appreciated by elders who find it a small price for a night out, sans kids. An expressway runs through my town, though the exit and entrance lie in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the youth supported it, but the elders opposed it, claiming an expressway exit would spoil the town. Their persuasion led the city council to reject the request. A new high school is being constructed, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed, seemingly at random, with commercial zones where a wide array of businesses operate. These businesses include offices, various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's an abundance of new dining options and shops to explore. While some stores belong to large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods, made lively by nearby attractions. There are a couple of parks nearby, which are popular spots for families with young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse, featuring a significant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my neighborhood, there are even more people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can be a lengthy drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk in the city, as it is vast, and most prefer not to travel on foot. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and parking can be challenging to find anywhere. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings being added. While the city is a popular destination, many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increased traffic. Despite this, there is a variety of housing options, not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of various ages, and honestly, I'm not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few friends from the neighborhood who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is all there is!\" I responded, aware that the vast openness would surprise her. She was used to living in a town where the grocery store was just a short five-minute walk from her home—she had never experienced such expansive space before. As she marveled at the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down a narrow country road, you will come across a quarry filled with water, and just beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each with at least half an acre of land that the residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, there is an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. The driveways boast high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that sparkle in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As you continue toward my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing his lawn, singing above the sound of his mower. He is the source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely a wonderful person with an interesting history. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower as he has aged and lost some of his sharpness. Eventually, you'll reach my home. In the side yard, geese abound, pursued by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the water, and an occasional \"moo\" from the nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals—mostly just chasing them—there was always something to do, often with a neighborhood friend. The winters in my small town can be harsh, yet they possess a unique beauty. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blooms become skeletal structures of bark. When snow occasionally falls, it transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland overnight. The backyard is adorned with snow angels crafted by my little sister, along with snowmen. As kids, my sister and I often argued, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We built large igloo-like forts to store our 'ammunition,' using branches like an arsenal. In this little wonderland, we played pretend, at a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree kids."
