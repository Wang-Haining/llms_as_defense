            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most stunning locations in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is encircled by water, with beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. No matter where you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood exemplifies the essence of a small town. Houses are not crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, with some being updated and remodeled while others retain their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the area have older aluminum siding. The blocks around my house feature homes in every color you can imagine. Most houses have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America, where hardworking people strive to make a living and are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, you will see children running along the streets, as well as people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. You might see someone grilling outside and wave, or encounter someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and exchange a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left over from fall. The grass is green, mowed, and tidy. If there are plants and bushes in the yards, they are neatly trimmed. It isn't a neighborhood that impresses with stunning homes, but rather one that gives the impression of being a great place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it may look average, it is exceptional because it embodies what people desire—a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is right next to them. The city recycling center is a short distance away, providing services to locals and city residents. We have nearby baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and player names. Our small-town airport is adjacent to these fields. You can be indoors or out and hear the rumble of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is about 8 blocks away. It really is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburb with a uniform appearance. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll only see well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the association's efforts. The front yards look quite similar, featuring small patches of manicured grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads. Despite various families living here, the streets are kept in excellent shape, free from potholes. While most houses are single-story, there are some two-story ones as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each home, there is a communal mailbox setup similar to apartments, with a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, each accessible by key, and a couple of larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is again thanks to the HOA. My house is situated on the city's outskirts, making the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, there's ample space for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple well-maintained and gated community pools. There are also several walking trails, perfect for walking your dog or enjoying a solitary evening stroll, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is large enough for a good run. The community mostly consists of retirees, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals as well. The nearby city is quite large population-wise but retains a small-town vibe. It offers most standard amenities, including a single mall that, while not massive, is adequate. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of shops to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited stock and minimal staffing to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and fairly typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. While we're not immediately next to shopping areas, a short drive will take you to any major retailer you desire.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was from a podcast discussing missing people. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither I nor my friends had heard about that story before. Maybe it’s the challenge. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high costs, but over time, we’ve become skilled at being thrifty. You grow fond of the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that smell of mothballs. As adults, we tend to notice smells less. You might pick up smoking, or simply become used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market's presence is always felt. The scent of adulthood resembles old magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself into leather and lingers even after washing. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio store. Downtown is bustling, crowded with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the shops remain silent. It’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city grows busier, filled with cars and people. They call it a developing city, home to one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still adjusting to growth. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own objectives, and not much is expected of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and self-reliant, and people will respect your space. It’s unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, you don’t intrude into others’ lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It’s an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In some ways, we’re less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and look out for each other. It’s nice to see them, and I think they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern city, it’s neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven’t completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, located just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the east side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area here. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amicable, often greeting me with smiles and hellos as I walk by. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has only been indirectly affected by crime, with occasional items disappearing from our porch if left out. Overall, our town has been deeply impacted by the opioid crisis that has afflicted many areas in the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are many resources available here to address this issue, including several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town offers many positives. My son’s elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not experienced any bullying due to the school’s incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. The PTO is active, organizing numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational growth. With over 20% of the town’s population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town’s appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these efforts have been concentrated in the town center and west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are located, leaving the east side where I live somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. Despite these issues, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are plenty of shopping options, ranging from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family’s needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Nestled on a hill, it's surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill is a charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends, especially in June and July, you often see lines of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious given its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. While it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, keeps them warmer. They are also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing and showering facilities. What I love about my city is not just the charm of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered throughout the hills rolling toward the ocean. What I truly cherish about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous as the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast due to gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these events, and tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders that plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood is typical of an American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is generally quiet during the week. I've never had issues with anyone here; people leave you alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online without any being stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from the park when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the positive memories outweigh that. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now brings me a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of nearby food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine within a mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned shop for those wanting to cook or buy Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading horror stories about neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to my college. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, along with some fun and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit more expensive, but the quality of drinks and service is decent. The people here are generally nice; many are college students or from lower-income backgrounds, as the apartments are quite affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors well, nor do I wish to, as they smoke a lot of weed. The management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and almost offensive. The buildings in the area mostly look old but might have updated interiors. There are new apartments down the street, but I dislike them because they're poorly constructed yet expensive to rent, which seems like a rip-off considering their proximity to campus. There's a very cheap restaurant about five minutes away that uses paper plates and mostly serves microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. Fortunately, the city funded improvements last summer, so the roads have new sidewalks and grassy medians, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind us is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. Although there are many trees, they seem to hide the buildings' poor appearance. Most crimes occur at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I can't solely blame them since the apartments across from me also experience crime and have a transient population. Overall, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities nearby. I appreciate being within walking distance of the university and having two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes are scattered along a cul-de-sac, designed to resemble individual houses. They all share a uniform look, painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, and on some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway for casual chats while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This setting offers a refreshing contrast to the modern, tech-driven world, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The area is surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog stayed nervously in the living room, barking at the unusual situation. The only sounds outside were of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, melting the hail upon impact. As the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared, prompting me to dash inside for my camera to capture the moment and share it on Facebook, where it amazed my friends and family. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm, and life resumed with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. This welcoming neighborhood is a joy for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I love the local southern accent. Everyone here has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors differ, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and down to the non-swimmable pond. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, the giant bullfrog can be heard singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms, adding to the village-like feel of the community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share my experiences. When I first arrived in my neighborhood, I was quite sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t deny it—I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and schools, a location that was considered “not ghetto.” Over time, I adapted, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, since they lived next door. They’ve been wonderful people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got remarried) with my family. It was incredibly fun, and I look forward to having a similar experience someday, as I work to build a prosperous life for my future wife. At the wedding, when Ms. Veda tossed the garter, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s doing well in life. My neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. My exploration has mostly been with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of life. I sometimes visit the park to enjoy nature, which brings me peace and calm. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword when I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are basketball and tennis courts too, though I haven’t played in a while. It’s nice to have the option if I want to try again. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I’ve had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and while there are many stories to tell, these are the highlights. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town that doesn't particularly stand out from others in South Carolina, yet it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry. Johnston proudly declares itself as the Peach Capital of the World, a claim featured on its welcome sign. The area is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two-story buildings with either metal roofs to combat the hot summer sun or gray shingles. Typically, these houses are set back from the road, with the front fields used for livestock or crops. In the town center, a single traffic light hangs over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town's only stores. \"Fast food\" options here include Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but has recently closed. There's a tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known humorously for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, leading many locals to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. Dollar General is the town's most popular store, bustling from open to close with its wide selection of daily necessities. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known local woman, has been a Johnston fixture for years and offers delivery service. Attached to this store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The only school is Johnston Elementary School, with middle and high school students attending classes in the neighboring town. While the town lacks parks, it is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more activities and attract visitors or new residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants, the town is endearing and small enough to pass through before you even notice!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I’ve become familiar with most of the residents. People typically occupy themselves with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that frequent the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we tend to notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids often ride their bikes, as you’d expect. We work from home, so we’re around a lot. Our family includes my wife, our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and myself. I assume the neighbors are accustomed to our comings and goings as well. We like to play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of grilling. From March to October, someone is always mowing their lawn, so the sound of a lawnmower is nearly constant. Originally a wooded area, our neighborhood has many trees offering ample shade, but they also bring plenty of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged autumn. Our garage is situated at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless there's a knock, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. The area is quite serene during holidays. Thanksgiving brings some families visiting from out of town, resulting in extra parked cars. The same occurs during holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt. Unless someone has lived here, they might not fully grasp what it's like to constantly see brown landscapes. A lawn is a rare sight, and when you do spot one, it’s clear that the owner is spending a lot on its maintenance. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely distributed. Although there are many new developments now, the spread-out nature remains. Honestly, this place increasingly resembles a city every day, but I suppose that's a common trend. Generally, people here are very friendly, though, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by amicable elderly people, making it a nicer area. The stores mostly consist of chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel; I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores nearby. Construction seems to be the most prevalent job in my city, though this is just my observation. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning as I prefer the current state. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. My job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty, among other reasons. The climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection, supporting various wildlife. Residents should learn about these non-human inhabitants to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write, they’re outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a fun and engaging time. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports activities to enjoy. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert can visit the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unique. While most people answering this question are likely homeowners with their own separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the residents of my dormitory are my community. I also include the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this difference, my neighborhood has similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. In my immediate area, there are three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around 2 floors, meaning roughly 20 people live in each building. Second, there are actual houses available for rent by those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, often rented by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are standard dorm rooms housing hundreds of students. Typically, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common housing type in my neighborhood. With housing described, we can move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while new students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students stay in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people here with mere words, so I'll move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has numerous stores and one park. The stores include a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's borders! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, maintained clean and safe by the community members themselves!",
            "There are few sidewalks in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my home is perched at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. It's known as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers include it in their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has some potholes and can feel a bit unsafe to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often damage the power lines, leading to constant repairs that make them look patchwork-like. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but residents don't like them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so sunlight is often seen through a mist. Most days are overcast and damp, causing moss to grow on everything, from roofs to cars and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in green moss that took three hours to remove. There aren't many children around, despite a school nearby. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs, which are often seen on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak inside. I once found one in my living room and had to escort it out. Rabbits roam freely here, and some are quite large, which gardeners dislike because they dig up plant roots and burrow in lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most out of the neighborhood. We also have typical birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, with an occasional hawk or eagle, though neighborhood crows usually chase them away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few seafood restaurants. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't find it hard to reach! Public transportation is easily available and is one of the most used ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban area, so you'll still experience the New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to see a variety of Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has experienced an increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll come across an Asian-owned store on nearly every block while walking. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are favored by locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food, the prices are significantly lower, and they provide convenience. Just near where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from one another, adding to the ease of getting groceries. However, I'm not suggesting Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is actually quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most of the major and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these, there's also a recently upgraded park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are very diverse, where everyone can play and interact well together. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The buildings you'll find are mainly co-op living spaces or condominium apartments. Most residences here are two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, although quite loud. Daily, you might hear cars with loud music passing by your house or revving their engines, which might wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay cautious. The neighborhood is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might encounter individuals looking to cause trouble, such as bullies and thieves. I have personally experienced bullying here in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which, although common, occur in this neighborhood. Finally, even though New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here often ignore this rule. Every morning, you might see at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is encountering dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you need to understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza restaurant, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less recognized and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite a wave of wealthy Californians moving in and the continuous rise of new condominiums to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always imply being accepting, but it does mean embracing things typically deemed unacceptable. It doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences or issues. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland also has its share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps being weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes usually contain items someone no longer wants, often placed in cardboard or plastic containers, offering a magical find, perfect for a passerby, more often than you'd expect. They often have clothes and books but can contain anything. The charm of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me, though I'm just one of many kinds of weird here. Some local residents wouldn't dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is teeming with people who have diverse interests. It's a place where people chase their dreams or dream of chasing them while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a challenge with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn here by the relatively better social services, though these services are still inadequate, as is the case nationwide. Residents' attitudes toward the homeless fluctuate between compassion and animosity, and in this regard, Portland isn't unique at all.",
            "The mountains remain constant, always present in the north, observing the sun's travels at dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them, preoccupied with work and life, they stand firm, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I gaze at them, they offer solace to my anxious heart, providing strength to carry on, one day at a time. When I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains near the campus were what initially captivated me. Although the university has its own stunning features, like its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way, with numerous cafés that served as venues for countless hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A brief walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an antique atmosphere that rivals the hustle and energy of the nearby city. This bustling vibe doesn't extend far, as one can quickly return to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments in close proximity gives the city a magical allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to form cherished memories linked to different parts of town, whether it's strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. However, like all places, it also holds harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as ideal spots for reflection or for tearful moments during existential crises at two in the morning, which I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects play their roles in life often led me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, the park, and the suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always, the towering mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—it's set in a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, a location not typically associated with housing. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are usually only filled during summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Within this neighborhood, the streets are lined with several apartment complexes, neatly arranged like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and aligned along the road. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory events, so we'll gloss over those—looks can be misleading. Next to them, though, are two other complexes that belong to a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where students, armed with coffee, arrive at 7 a.m., yawning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to welcome them, while commuters grumble and gesticulate at them for causing traffic delays on busy days. The road leads to another residential street, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from bone injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a gently spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children frolic in the park across the street, performing cartwheels and dashing across the grass, while bees meander among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the paths, frowning at teen skateboarders and smiling at the girls who are chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable meals but rarely seems crowded. Next to it, there's a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—a convenience provided by the strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold, dripping cups topped with treats as they skateboard and vape, believing it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a historical piece in the quiet South where things remain unchanged, even time itself.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most of the homes are single-family, although some have been divided into two connected units, if that makes sense. My house has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it reminds you of a time not too long ago when suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the people of this country, but now it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, still exists, still beckoning us and visitors to believe that the dream is alive, and we're holding onto it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the little yards aren't as well-maintained, but there are still a couple of cars in every driveway, and children play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. Each home looks different but feels the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, interest waned, and it turned into a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted rate, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but cherished by the older folks who appreciate a reasonably priced night out, sans kids. An expressway cuts through my town, though the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would disrupt the town, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is very diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, which host a variety of businesses. These businesses include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. Some shops are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, while small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and along streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods that are surrounded by numerous attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks frequented by people with young children. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite notable, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my neighborhood, there are many more individuals from various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away, but even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in the city because, despite some attractions being close, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. As a result, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and parking is challenging to find. Despite this, there has been significant construction recently, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. This trend makes it a popular destination, but many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increasing traffic. The city offers a variety of housing, as not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, which is true even in my immediate neighborhood, showcasing a diversity of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I remember playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were my age during my childhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk away—never before had she encountered so much open space. As she marveled at the expansive cornfields, I recounted my experiences growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally understood my roots. Traveling down a two-lane country road, we arrived at a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes, mainly made of brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of well-tended land. During spring, the area is vibrant with annually planted flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sparkling Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed and gleaming in the midday sun. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, was outside, usually spending the day mowing his lawn and singing over the sound of his mower. The neighborhood finds amusement in his antics, but he is genuinely kind and has an intriguing past. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam while our Terrier chases after them. Behind the house, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the flowing water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched paradise brimming with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly just chasing them), there was always an adventure, often shared with neighborhood friends. Winters in my town can be harsh yet stunning. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. Trees once adorned with vibrant blossoms become bare. When snow falls, it creates a magical wonderland overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We often bickered as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We constructed igloo-like forts for our snowball stash, usually using branches. In our private wonderland, we played and imagined, free from worries, simply being carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most stunning locations in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is encircled by water, with beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. No matter where you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood exemplifies the essence of a small town. Houses are not crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, with some being updated and remodeled while others retain their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the area have older aluminum siding. The blocks around my house feature homes in every color you can imagine. Most houses have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America, where hardworking people strive to make a living and are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, you will see children running along the streets, as well as people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. You might see someone grilling outside and wave, or encounter someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and exchange a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left over from fall. The grass is green, mowed, and tidy. If there are plants and bushes in the yards, they are neatly trimmed. It isn't a neighborhood that impresses with stunning homes, but rather one that gives the impression of being a great place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it may look average, it is exceptional because it embodies what people desire—a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is right next to them. The city recycling center is a short distance away, providing services to locals and city residents. We have nearby baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and player names. Our small-town airport is adjacent to these fields. You can be indoors or out and hear the rumble of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is about 8 blocks away. It really is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburb with a uniform appearance. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll only see well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the association's efforts. The front yards look quite similar, featuring small patches of manicured grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads. Despite various families living here, the streets are kept in excellent shape, free from potholes. While most houses are single-story, there are some two-story ones as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each home, there is a communal mailbox setup similar to apartments, with a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, each accessible by key, and a couple of larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is again thanks to the HOA. My house is situated on the city's outskirts, making the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, there's ample space for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple well-maintained and gated community pools. There are also several walking trails, perfect for walking your dog or enjoying a solitary evening stroll, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is large enough for a good run. The community mostly consists of retirees, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals as well. The nearby city is quite large population-wise but retains a small-town vibe. It offers most standard amenities, including a single mall that, while not massive, is adequate. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of shops to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited stock and minimal staffing to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and fairly typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. While we're not immediately next to shopping areas, a short drive will take you to any major retailer you desire.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was from a podcast discussing missing people. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither I nor my friends had heard about that story before. Maybe it’s the challenge. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high costs, but over time, we’ve become skilled at being thrifty. You grow fond of the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that smell of mothballs. As adults, we tend to notice smells less. You might pick up smoking, or simply become used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market's presence is always felt. The scent of adulthood resembles old magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself into leather and lingers even after washing. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio store. Downtown is bustling, crowded with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the shops remain silent. It’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city grows busier, filled with cars and people. They call it a developing city, home to one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still adjusting to growth. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own objectives, and not much is expected of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and self-reliant, and people will respect your space. It’s unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, you don’t intrude into others’ lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It’s an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In some ways, we’re less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and look out for each other. It’s nice to see them, and I think they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern city, it’s neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven’t completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, located just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the east side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area here. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amicable, often greeting me with smiles and hellos as I walk by. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has only been indirectly affected by crime, with occasional items disappearing from our porch if left out. Overall, our town has been deeply impacted by the opioid crisis that has afflicted many areas in the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are many resources available here to address this issue, including several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town offers many positives. My son’s elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not experienced any bullying due to the school’s incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. The PTO is active, organizing numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational growth. With over 20% of the town’s population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town’s appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these efforts have been concentrated in the town center and west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are located, leaving the east side where I live somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. Despite these issues, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are plenty of shopping options, ranging from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family’s needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Nestled on a hill, it's surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill is a charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends, especially in June and July, you often see lines of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious given its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. While it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, keeps them warmer. They are also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing and showering facilities. What I love about my city is not just the charm of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered throughout the hills rolling toward the ocean. What I truly cherish about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous as the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast due to gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these events, and tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders that plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood is typical of an American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is generally quiet during the week. I've never had issues with anyone here; people leave you alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online without any being stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from the park when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the positive memories outweigh that. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now brings me a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of nearby food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine within a mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned shop for those wanting to cook or buy Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading horror stories about neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to my college. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, along with some fun and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit more expensive, but the quality of drinks and service is decent. The people here are generally nice; many are college students or from lower-income backgrounds, as the apartments are quite affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors well, nor do I wish to, as they smoke a lot of weed. The management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and almost offensive. The buildings in the area mostly look old but might have updated interiors. There are new apartments down the street, but I dislike them because they're poorly constructed yet expensive to rent, which seems like a rip-off considering their proximity to campus. There's a very cheap restaurant about five minutes away that uses paper plates and mostly serves microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. Fortunately, the city funded improvements last summer, so the roads have new sidewalks and grassy medians, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind us is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. Although there are many trees, they seem to hide the buildings' poor appearance. Most crimes occur at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I can't solely blame them since the apartments across from me also experience crime and have a transient population. Overall, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities nearby. I appreciate being within walking distance of the university and having two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes are scattered along a cul-de-sac, designed to resemble individual houses. They all share a uniform look, painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, and on some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway for casual chats while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This setting offers a refreshing contrast to the modern, tech-driven world, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The area is surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog stayed nervously in the living room, barking at the unusual situation. The only sounds outside were of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, melting the hail upon impact. As the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared, prompting me to dash inside for my camera to capture the moment and share it on Facebook, where it amazed my friends and family. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm, and life resumed with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. This welcoming neighborhood is a joy for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I love the local southern accent. Everyone here has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors differ, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and down to the non-swimmable pond. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, the giant bullfrog can be heard singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms, adding to the village-like feel of the community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share my experiences. When I first arrived in my neighborhood, I was quite sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t deny it—I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and schools, a location that was considered “not ghetto.” Over time, I adapted, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, since they lived next door. They’ve been wonderful people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got remarried) with my family. It was incredibly fun, and I look forward to having a similar experience someday, as I work to build a prosperous life for my future wife. At the wedding, when Ms. Veda tossed the garter, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s doing well in life. My neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. My exploration has mostly been with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of life. I sometimes visit the park to enjoy nature, which brings me peace and calm. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword when I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are basketball and tennis courts too, though I haven’t played in a while. It’s nice to have the option if I want to try again. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I’ve had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and while there are many stories to tell, these are the highlights. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town that doesn't particularly stand out from others in South Carolina, yet it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry. Johnston proudly declares itself as the Peach Capital of the World, a claim featured on its welcome sign. The area is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two-story buildings with either metal roofs to combat the hot summer sun or gray shingles. Typically, these houses are set back from the road, with the front fields used for livestock or crops. In the town center, a single traffic light hangs over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town's only stores. \"Fast food\" options here include Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but has recently closed. There's a tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known humorously for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, leading many locals to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. Dollar General is the town's most popular store, bustling from open to close with its wide selection of daily necessities. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known local woman, has been a Johnston fixture for years and offers delivery service. Attached to this store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The only school is Johnston Elementary School, with middle and high school students attending classes in the neighboring town. While the town lacks parks, it is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more activities and attract visitors or new residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants, the town is endearing and small enough to pass through before you even notice!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I’ve become familiar with most of the residents. People typically occupy themselves with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that frequent the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we tend to notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids often ride their bikes, as you’d expect. We work from home, so we’re around a lot. Our family includes my wife, our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and myself. I assume the neighbors are accustomed to our comings and goings as well. We like to play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of grilling. From March to October, someone is always mowing their lawn, so the sound of a lawnmower is nearly constant. Originally a wooded area, our neighborhood has many trees offering ample shade, but they also bring plenty of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged autumn. Our garage is situated at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless there's a knock, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. The area is quite serene during holidays. Thanksgiving brings some families visiting from out of town, resulting in extra parked cars. The same occurs during holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt. Unless someone has lived here, they might not fully grasp what it's like to constantly see brown landscapes. A lawn is a rare sight, and when you do spot one, it’s clear that the owner is spending a lot on its maintenance. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely distributed. Although there are many new developments now, the spread-out nature remains. Honestly, this place increasingly resembles a city every day, but I suppose that's a common trend. Generally, people here are very friendly, though, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by amicable elderly people, making it a nicer area. The stores mostly consist of chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel; I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores nearby. Construction seems to be the most prevalent job in my city, though this is just my observation. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning as I prefer the current state. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. My job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty, among other reasons. The climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection, supporting various wildlife. Residents should learn about these non-human inhabitants to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write, they’re outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a fun and engaging time. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports activities to enjoy. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert can visit the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unique. While most people answering this question are likely homeowners with their own separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the residents of my dormitory are my community. I also include the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this difference, my neighborhood has similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. In my immediate area, there are three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around 2 floors, meaning roughly 20 people live in each building. Second, there are actual houses available for rent by those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, often rented by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are standard dorm rooms housing hundreds of students. Typically, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common housing type in my neighborhood. With housing described, we can move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while new students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students stay in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people here with mere words, so I'll move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has numerous stores and one park. The stores include a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's borders! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, maintained clean and safe by the community members themselves!",
            "There are few sidewalks in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my home is perched at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. It's known as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers include it in their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has some potholes and can feel a bit unsafe to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often damage the power lines, leading to constant repairs that make them look patchwork-like. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but residents don't like them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so sunlight is often seen through a mist. Most days are overcast and damp, causing moss to grow on everything, from roofs to cars and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in green moss that took three hours to remove. There aren't many children around, despite a school nearby. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs, which are often seen on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak inside. I once found one in my living room and had to escort it out. Rabbits roam freely here, and some are quite large, which gardeners dislike because they dig up plant roots and burrow in lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most out of the neighborhood. We also have typical birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, with an occasional hawk or eagle, though neighborhood crows usually chase them away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few seafood restaurants. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't find it hard to reach! Public transportation is easily available and is one of the most used ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban area, so you'll still experience the New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to see a variety of Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has experienced an increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll come across an Asian-owned store on nearly every block while walking. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are favored by locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food, the prices are significantly lower, and they provide convenience. Just near where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from one another, adding to the ease of getting groceries. However, I'm not suggesting Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is actually quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most of the major and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these, there's also a recently upgraded park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are very diverse, where everyone can play and interact well together. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The buildings you'll find are mainly co-op living spaces or condominium apartments. Most residences here are two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, although quite loud. Daily, you might hear cars with loud music passing by your house or revving their engines, which might wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay cautious. The neighborhood is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might encounter individuals looking to cause trouble, such as bullies and thieves. I have personally experienced bullying here in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which, although common, occur in this neighborhood. Finally, even though New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here often ignore this rule. Every morning, you might see at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is encountering dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you need to understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza restaurant, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less recognized and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite a wave of wealthy Californians moving in and the continuous rise of new condominiums to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always imply being accepting, but it does mean embracing things typically deemed unacceptable. It doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences or issues. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland also has its share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps being weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes usually contain items someone no longer wants, often placed in cardboard or plastic containers, offering a magical find, perfect for a passerby, more often than you'd expect. They often have clothes and books but can contain anything. The charm of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me, though I'm just one of many kinds of weird here. Some local residents wouldn't dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is teeming with people who have diverse interests. It's a place where people chase their dreams or dream of chasing them while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a challenge with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn here by the relatively better social services, though these services are still inadequate, as is the case nationwide. Residents' attitudes toward the homeless fluctuate between compassion and animosity, and in this regard, Portland isn't unique at all.",
            "The mountains remain constant, always present in the north, observing the sun's travels at dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them, preoccupied with work and life, they stand firm, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I gaze at them, they offer solace to my anxious heart, providing strength to carry on, one day at a time. When I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains near the campus were what initially captivated me. Although the university has its own stunning features, like its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way, with numerous cafés that served as venues for countless hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A brief walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an antique atmosphere that rivals the hustle and energy of the nearby city. This bustling vibe doesn't extend far, as one can quickly return to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments in close proximity gives the city a magical allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to form cherished memories linked to different parts of town, whether it's strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. However, like all places, it also holds harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as ideal spots for reflection or for tearful moments during existential crises at two in the morning, which I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects play their roles in life often led me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, the park, and the suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always, the towering mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—it's set in a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, a location not typically associated with housing. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are usually only filled during summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Within this neighborhood, the streets are lined with several apartment complexes, neatly arranged like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and aligned along the road. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory events, so we'll gloss over those—looks can be misleading. Next to them, though, are two other complexes that belong to a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where students, armed with coffee, arrive at 7 a.m., yawning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to welcome them, while commuters grumble and gesticulate at them for causing traffic delays on busy days. The road leads to another residential street, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from bone injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a gently spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children frolic in the park across the street, performing cartwheels and dashing across the grass, while bees meander among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the paths, frowning at teen skateboarders and smiling at the girls who are chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable meals but rarely seems crowded. Next to it, there's a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—a convenience provided by the strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold, dripping cups topped with treats as they skateboard and vape, believing it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a historical piece in the quiet South where things remain unchanged, even time itself.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most of the homes are single-family, although some have been divided into two connected units, if that makes sense. My house has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it reminds you of a time not too long ago when suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the people of this country, but now it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, still exists, still beckoning us and visitors to believe that the dream is alive, and we're holding onto it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the little yards aren't as well-maintained, but there are still a couple of cars in every driveway, and children play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. Each home looks different but feels the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, interest waned, and it turned into a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted rate, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but cherished by the older folks who appreciate a reasonably priced night out, sans kids. An expressway cuts through my town, though the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would disrupt the town, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is very diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, which host a variety of businesses. These businesses include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. Some shops are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, while small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and along streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods that are surrounded by numerous attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks frequented by people with young children. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite notable, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my neighborhood, there are many more individuals from various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away, but even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in the city because, despite some attractions being close, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. As a result, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and parking is challenging to find. Despite this, there has been significant construction recently, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. This trend makes it a popular destination, but many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increasing traffic. The city offers a variety of housing, as not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, which is true even in my immediate neighborhood, showcasing a diversity of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I remember playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were my age during my childhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk away—never before had she encountered so much open space. As she marveled at the expansive cornfields, I recounted my experiences growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally understood my roots. Traveling down a two-lane country road, we arrived at a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes, mainly made of brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of well-tended land. During spring, the area is vibrant with annually planted flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sparkling Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed and gleaming in the midday sun. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, was outside, usually spending the day mowing his lawn and singing over the sound of his mower. The neighborhood finds amusement in his antics, but he is genuinely kind and has an intriguing past. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam while our Terrier chases after them. Behind the house, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the flowing water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched paradise brimming with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly just chasing them), there was always an adventure, often shared with neighborhood friends. Winters in my town can be harsh yet stunning. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. Trees once adorned with vibrant blossoms become bare. When snow falls, it creates a magical wonderland overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We often bickered as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We constructed igloo-like forts for our snowball stash, usually using branches. In our private wonderland, we played and imagined, free from worries, simply being carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most stunning locations in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is encircled by water, with beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. No matter where you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood exemplifies the essence of a small town. Houses are not crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, with some being updated and remodeled while others retain their original charm. Most homes have full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the area have older aluminum siding. The blocks around my house feature homes in every color you can imagine. Most houses have yards, often with trampolines and playsets. Some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America, where hardworking people strive to make a living and are either raising families or have already done so. On any given day, you will see children running along the streets, as well as people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs and who doesn’t. You might see someone grilling outside and wave, or encounter someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and exchange a friendly smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no piles of leaves left over from fall. The grass is green, mowed, and tidy. If there are plants and bushes in the yards, they are neatly trimmed. It isn't a neighborhood that impresses with stunning homes, but rather one that gives the impression of being a great place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it may look average, it is exceptional because it embodies what people desire—a safe haven at the end of the day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is right next to them. The city recycling center is a short distance away, providing services to locals and city residents. We have nearby baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and player names. Our small-town airport is adjacent to these fields. You can be indoors or out and hear the rumble of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local shop, and if you're up for it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is about 8 blocks away. It really is a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburb with a uniform appearance. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you'll only see well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the association's efforts. The front yards look quite similar, featuring small patches of manicured grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways, with occasional small trees. Each house has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved roads. Despite various families living here, the streets are kept in excellent shape, free from potholes. While most houses are single-story, there are some two-story ones as well. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each home, there is a communal mailbox setup similar to apartments, with a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, each accessible by key, and a couple of larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is again thanks to the HOA. My house is situated on the city's outskirts, making the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, there's ample space for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple well-maintained and gated community pools. There are also several walking trails, perfect for walking your dog or enjoying a solitary evening stroll, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is large enough for a good run. The community mostly consists of retirees, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals as well. The nearby city is quite large population-wise but retains a small-town vibe. It offers most standard amenities, including a single mall that, while not massive, is adequate. It takes me about 15 minutes by car to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of shops to choose from, ranging from high-end grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited stock and minimal staffing to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-kept, and fairly typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. While we're not immediately next to shopping areas, a short drive will take you to any major retailer you desire.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was from a podcast discussing missing people. It caught me off guard. Almost every apartment in the neighborhood rents for over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither I nor my friends had heard about that story before. Maybe it’s the challenge. Some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night because of the high costs, but over time, we’ve become skilled at being thrifty. You grow fond of the musty scent of flea market toys and clothes that smell of mothballs. As adults, we tend to notice smells less. You might pick up smoking, or simply become used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market's presence is always felt. The scent of adulthood resembles old magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself into leather and lingers even after washing. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift stores, a library, a rare bookshop, and a curio store. Downtown is bustling, crowded with cars and people every morning, but you’d never hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the shops remain silent. It’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Each year, the city grows busier, filled with cars and people. They call it a developing city, home to one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still adjusting to growth. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own objectives, and not much is expected of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and self-reliant, and people will respect your space. It’s unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, you don’t intrude into others’ lives. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It’s an energetic place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In some ways, we’re less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to tidy up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail and look out for each other. It’s nice to see them, and I think they appreciate my company as much as I do theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern city, it’s neighbors like mine that make me feel I haven’t completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small town in the Midwest, located just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My neighborhood, situated on the east side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area here. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amicable, often greeting me with smiles and hellos as I walk by. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. There have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home over the past decade, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has only been indirectly affected by crime, with occasional items disappearing from our porch if left out. Overall, our town has been deeply impacted by the opioid crisis that has afflicted many areas in the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. However, there are many resources available here to address this issue, including several addiction rehab centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town offers many positives. My son’s elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not experienced any bullying due to the school’s incredibly positive environment, and he loves attending. The PTO is active, organizing numerous events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational growth. With over 20% of the town’s population living below the poverty line, the school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are quite affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant improvements to the town’s appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and renovating city parks. Unfortunately, most of these efforts have been concentrated in the town center and west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are located, leaving the east side where I live somewhat overlooked, which is a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. Despite these issues, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are plenty of shopping options, ranging from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family’s needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Nestled on a hill, it's surrounded by historically significant buildings. I reside in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill is a charming arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends, especially in June and July, you often see lines of people waiting to enter. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite spacious given its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. While it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. Setting their tents close together in the city center, rather than in the outskirts, keeps them warmer. They are also within a reasonable distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing and showering facilities. What I love about my city is not just the charm of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered throughout the hills rolling toward the ocean. What I truly cherish about my neighborhood is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous as the most dangerous neighborhood on the West Coast due to gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal agents and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The community remembers these events, and tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the people work hard to maintain its cleanliness and care about their city and their block. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders that plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions stem from ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just before starting eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close to someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood is typical of an American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is generally quiet during the week. I've never had issues with anyone here; people leave you alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online without any being stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from the park when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the positive memories outweigh that. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who love playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now brings me a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, with a variety of nearby food options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisine within a mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places, too. The local stores have everything you need, with several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned shop for those wanting to cook or buy Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading horror stories about neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to my college. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, along with some fun and reasonably priced restaurants and bars. One bar recently changed its name and is a bit more expensive, but the quality of drinks and service is decent. The people here are generally nice; many are college students or from lower-income backgrounds, as the apartments are quite affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors well, nor do I wish to, as they smoke a lot of weed. The management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing and almost offensive. The buildings in the area mostly look old but might have updated interiors. There are new apartments down the street, but I dislike them because they're poorly constructed yet expensive to rent, which seems like a rip-off considering their proximity to campus. There's a very cheap restaurant about five minutes away that uses paper plates and mostly serves microwaved food. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a poor workplace. Fortunately, the city funded improvements last summer, so the roads have new sidewalks and grassy medians, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but 43rd Street behind us is less appealing, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. Although there are many trees, they seem to hide the buildings' poor appearance. Most crimes occur at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but I can't solely blame them since the apartments across from me also experience crime and have a transient population. Overall, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities nearby. I appreciate being within walking distance of the university and having two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes are scattered along a cul-de-sac, designed to resemble individual houses. They all share a uniform look, painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, and on some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway for casual chats while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. This setting offers a refreshing contrast to the modern, tech-driven world, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The area is surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows, while my larger dog stayed nervously in the living room, barking at the unusual situation. The only sounds outside were of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, melting the hail upon impact. As the skies cleared, a double rainbow appeared, prompting me to dash inside for my camera to capture the moment and share it on Facebook, where it amazed my friends and family. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm, and life resumed with mothers and children outside while dinner cooked. This welcoming neighborhood is a joy for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I love the local southern accent. Everyone here has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, though the interiors differ, with some being quite small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the large field behind my home and down to the non-swimmable pond. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, the giant bullfrog can be heard singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning, roosters crow from nearby farms, adding to the village-like feel of the community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was fortunate to find this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share my experiences. When I first arrived in my neighborhood, I was quite sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t deny it—I cried because I missed my old friends and loved them dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we moved to a place with better housing and schools, a location that was considered “not ghetto.” Over time, I adapted, made new friends, and even some enemies at school. I never really got to know many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, since they lived next door. They’ve been wonderful people, almost like family, and I truly appreciate them. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got remarried) with my family. It was incredibly fun, and I look forward to having a similar experience someday, as I work to build a prosperous life for my future wife. At the wedding, when Ms. Veda tossed the garter, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s doing well in life. My neighborhood feels like a maze, but with GPS, I can explore more. My exploration has mostly been with friends Kason and Curtis, playing video games and making the most of life. I sometimes visit the park to enjoy nature, which brings me peace and calm. I practice my balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword when I can. I enjoy doing what I love. There are basketball and tennis courts too, though I haven’t played in a while. It’s nice to have the option if I want to try again. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast, even though they pushed us hard. I’ve had many enjoyable moments in this neighborhood, and while there are many stories to tell, these are the highlights. I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town that doesn't particularly stand out from others in South Carolina, yet it plays a significant role in the agricultural industry. Johnston proudly declares itself as the Peach Capital of the World, a claim featured on its welcome sign. The area is primarily farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two-story buildings with either metal roofs to combat the hot summer sun or gray shingles. Typically, these houses are set back from the road, with the front fields used for livestock or crops. In the town center, a single traffic light hangs over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town's only stores. \"Fast food\" options here include Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but has recently closed. There's a tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, known humorously for their Cherry Coca-Cola. The only grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, leading many locals to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their shopping. Dollar General is the town's most popular store, bustling from open to close with its wide selection of daily necessities. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a well-known local woman, has been a Johnston fixture for years and offers delivery service. Attached to this store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business offering daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing services. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The only school is Johnston Elementary School, with middle and high school students attending classes in the neighboring town. While the town lacks parks, it is currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more activities and attract visitors or new residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants, the town is endearing and small enough to pass through before you even notice!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area within a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which means there's more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I’ve become familiar with most of the residents. People typically occupy themselves with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Our house is located at the front corner of our street, so we observe everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars that frequent the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we tend to notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids often ride their bikes, as you’d expect. We work from home, so we’re around a lot. Our family includes my wife, our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and myself. I assume the neighbors are accustomed to our comings and goings as well. We like to play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of grilling. From March to October, someone is always mowing their lawn, so the sound of a lawnmower is nearly constant. Originally a wooded area, our neighborhood has many trees offering ample shade, but they also bring plenty of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, making it feel like a prolonged autumn. Our garage is situated at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless there's a knock, which is uncommon. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. The area is quite serene during holidays. Thanksgiving brings some families visiting from out of town, resulting in extra parked cars. The same occurs during holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt. Unless someone has lived here, they might not fully grasp what it's like to constantly see brown landscapes. A lawn is a rare sight, and when you do spot one, it’s clear that the owner is spending a lot on its maintenance. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, the houses were sparsely distributed. Although there are many new developments now, the spread-out nature remains. Honestly, this place increasingly resembles a city every day, but I suppose that's a common trend. Generally, people here are very friendly, though, like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by amicable elderly people, making it a nicer area. The stores mostly consist of chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel; I rarely see any Whole Foods or similar stores nearby. Construction seems to be the most prevalent job in my city, though this is just my observation. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning as I prefer the current state. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. My job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I appreciate about my home is the variety of animals. People are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty, among other reasons. The climate and terrain have created unique ecosystems that need protection, supporting various wildlife. Residents should learn about these non-human inhabitants to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write, they’re outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit during the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a fun and engaging time. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports activities to enjoy. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert can visit the Victor Valley Museum, which features geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is probably a bit unique. While most people answering this question are likely homeowners with their own separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the residents of my dormitory are my community. I also include the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this difference, my neighborhood has similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the \"houses\" in my neighborhood. Before diving into the details, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. In my immediate area, there are three types of housing: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around 2 floors, meaning roughly 20 people live in each building. Second, there are actual houses available for rent by those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, often rented by alumni. However, there are only a few of these scattered around the neighborhood as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are standard dorm rooms housing hundreds of students. Typically, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common housing type in my neighborhood. With housing described, we can move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while new students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students stay in apartment-style housing. It's hard to do justice to the people here with mere words, so I'll move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has numerous stores and one park. The stores include a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's borders! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, maintained clean and safe by the community members themselves!",
            "There are few sidewalks in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my home is perched at the peak of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. It's known as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers include it in their daily routine. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road, which has some potholes and can feel a bit unsafe to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around the block look worn. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often damage the power lines, leading to constant repairs that make them look patchwork-like. The area is filled with tall evergreen trees, but residents don't like them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's stunning at sunset when the water appears to glow and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so sunlight is often seen through a mist. Most days are overcast and damp, causing moss to grow on everything, from roofs to cars and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was covered in green moss that took three hours to remove. There aren't many children around, despite a school nearby. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs, which are often seen on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, a dog might sneak inside. I once found one in my living room and had to escort it out. Rabbits roam freely here, and some are quite large, which gardeners dislike because they dig up plant roots and burrow in lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most out of the neighborhood. We also have typical birds like sparrows and hummingbirds, with an occasional hawk or eagle, though neighborhood crows usually chase them away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few seafood restaurants. The beach is small, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide, and you can see the opposite shore clearly, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't find it hard to reach! Public transportation is easily available and is one of the most used ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban area, so you'll still experience the New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to see a variety of Asian stores throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has experienced an increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll come across an Asian-owned store on nearly every block while walking. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are favored by locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food, the prices are significantly lower, and they provide convenience. Just near where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from one another, adding to the ease of getting groceries. However, I'm not suggesting Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is actually quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most of the major and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these, there's also a recently upgraded park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Since we're in New York City, the parks are very diverse, where everyone can play and interact well together. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The buildings you'll find are mainly co-op living spaces or condominium apartments. Most residences here are two-family houses. The people are generally friendly, although quite loud. Daily, you might hear cars with loud music passing by your house or revving their engines, which might wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay cautious. The neighborhood is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might encounter individuals looking to cause trouble, such as bullies and thieves. I have personally experienced bullying here in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Recently, there have been incidents of package theft, which, although common, occur in this neighborhood. Finally, even though New York City imposes fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here often ignore this rule. Every morning, you might see at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is encountering dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you need to understand the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza restaurant, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less recognized and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation to come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is now a compliment. Despite a wave of wealthy Californians moving in and the continuous rise of new condominiums to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always imply being accepting, but it does mean embracing things typically deemed unacceptable. It doesn't mean we're devoid of modern conveniences or issues. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland also has its share of the ordinary. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps being weird means we don't take these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll see vibrant houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes usually contain items someone no longer wants, often placed in cardboard or plastic containers, offering a magical find, perfect for a passerby, more often than you'd expect. They often have clothes and books but can contain anything. The charm of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies what Portland means to me, though I'm just one of many kinds of weird here. Some local residents wouldn't dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those individuals might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is teeming with people who have diverse interests. It's a place where people chase their dreams or dream of chasing them while perhaps spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug problem, which is often linked to mental health issues, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a challenge with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn here by the relatively better social services, though these services are still inadequate, as is the case nationwide. Residents' attitudes toward the homeless fluctuate between compassion and animosity, and in this regard, Portland isn't unique at all.",
            "The mountains remain constant, always present in the north, observing the sun's travels at dawn and dusk. Regardless of how often I overlook them, preoccupied with work and life, they stand firm, unaffected by life's challenges. On my most stressful days, they demand my attention, and when I gaze at them, they offer solace to my anxious heart, providing strength to carry on, one day at a time. When I first moved here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains near the campus were what initially captivated me. Although the university has its own stunning features, like its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own way, with numerous cafés that served as venues for countless hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A brief walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an antique atmosphere that rivals the hustle and energy of the nearby city. This bustling vibe doesn't extend far, as one can quickly return to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments in close proximity gives the city a magical allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to form cherished memories linked to different parts of town, whether it's strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. However, like all places, it also holds harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as ideal spots for reflection or for tearful moments during existential crises at two in the morning, which I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects play their roles in life often led me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's mysteries. I walked past the pond, the park, and the suburban houses until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always, the towering mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—it's set in a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, a location not typically associated with housing. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are usually only filled during summer for family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Within this neighborhood, the streets are lined with several apartment complexes, neatly arranged like Russian nesting dolls carefully disassembled and aligned along the road. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory events, so we'll gloss over those—looks can be misleading. Next to them, though, are two other complexes that belong to a different world, largely unknown to locals. Opposite these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college, where students, armed with coffee, arrive at 7 a.m., yawning as they start their day. The iron gates creak open to welcome them, while commuters grumble and gesticulate at them for causing traffic delays on busy days. The road leads to another residential street, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from bone injuries. The center features cheerful porch furniture and a gently spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children frolic in the park across the street, performing cartwheels and dashing across the grass, while bees meander among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the paths, frowning at teen skateboarders and smiling at the girls who are chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable meals but rarely seems crowded. Next to it, there's a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—a convenience provided by the strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab cold, dripping cups topped with treats as they skateboard and vape, believing it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a slice of Americana—a historical piece in the quiet South where things remain unchanged, even time itself.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most of the homes are single-family, although some have been divided into two connected units, if that makes sense. My house has a small yard in front and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it reminds you of a time not too long ago when suburban living was the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the people of this country, but now it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, still exists, still beckoning us and visitors to believe that the dream is alive, and we're holding onto it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the little yards aren't as well-maintained, but there are still a couple of cars in every driveway, and children play as if their world is all that matters. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are scarce and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. Each home looks different but feels the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a large Yemeni family, who are possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for generations and can share stories of a past when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, interest waned, and it turned into a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted rate, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but cherished by the older folks who appreciate a reasonably priced night out, sans kids. An expressway cuts through my town, though the exits are in the neighboring town. There was a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who feared it would disrupt the town, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is very diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, which host a variety of businesses. These businesses include offices, various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. Some shops are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, while small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are found in malls and along streets, often within walking distance of otherwise quiet neighborhoods that are surrounded by numerous attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks frequented by people with young children. The diversity in my neighborhood is quite notable, with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my neighborhood, there are many more individuals from various races and backgrounds, often forming their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are only a few miles away, but even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone walks in the city because, despite some attractions being close, the city is vast, and people generally avoid walking. As a result, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and parking is challenging to find. Despite this, there has been significant construction recently, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. This trend makes it a popular destination, but many residents are concerned about more people moving in and increasing traffic. The city offers a variety of housing, as not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas include houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, which is true even in my immediate neighborhood, showcasing a diversity of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and frankly, I don't know most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, although I remember playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were my age during my childhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we passed by the endless cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness of the landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk away—never before had she encountered so much open space. As she marveled at the expansive cornfields, I recounted my experiences growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she finally understood my roots. Traveling down a two-lane country road, we arrived at a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lies the small community where I reside. The homes, mainly made of brick and stucco, each boast at least half an acre of well-tended land. During spring, the area is vibrant with annually planted flowers and trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are lined with sparkling Mercedes Benz luxury cars, freshly washed and gleaming in the midday sun. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor, always cheerful, was outside, usually spending the day mowing his lawn and singing over the sound of his mower. The neighborhood finds amusement in his antics, but he is genuinely kind and has an intriguing past. Once a doctor, he now blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we reached my home. In the side yard, geese roam while our Terrier chases after them. Behind the house, a small stream feeds into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the flowing water, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched paradise brimming with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was my childhood playground. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly just chasing them), there was always an adventure, often shared with neighborhood friends. Winters in my town can be harsh yet stunning. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness. Trees once adorned with vibrant blossoms become bare. When snow falls, it creates a magical wonderland overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. We often bickered as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We constructed igloo-like forts for our snowball stash, usually using branches. In our private wonderland, we played and imagined, free from worries, simply being carefree children."
