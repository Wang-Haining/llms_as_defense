            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart or Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to reach any destination. Despite this, I am fortunate to live in one of the most stunning areas of the world, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are readily accessible for a quick dip almost everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren't crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some of which have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many homes have full basements visible from the street, and several feature older aluminum siding. The neighborhood boasts houses in a variety of colors, with most homes having yards. These yards often contain trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who either are or were raising families. On any given day, children run along the streets, and people can be seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize each other, and it's easy to spot newcomers. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. The lawns are well-maintained, without piles of fall leaves, and the green grass is neatly mowed. If there are plants or bushes, they are kept trimmed. This isn't a neighborhood that impresses with grand homes, but it's one where you sense it's an excellent place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it may look average, it stands out because it embodies what many desire—a secure place to come home to each day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff's department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, providing services to locals. Close by are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and players' names. Our small-town airport is adjacent, and you can hear the sounds of small planes taking off and landing while you're inside or outside. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're eager, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburban neighborhood. In my particular area, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’ll see only well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are nearly identical, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you’ll spot small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you’ll notice newly paved roads. Despite the many families living here, the streets are in excellent condition without any potholes. Most houses are single-story, although there are some two-story homes. We don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house as you might expect for single-family homes. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment setup, where residents use a key to access their mailbox, along with two larger lockers for packages. This is also due to the HOA’s focus on uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood has a blend of rural and suburban characteristics. Consequently, there is plenty of space for everything. We have several community pools that are well-maintained and gated for residents' use. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don’t need to visit a park to exercise, as the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mainly consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In relation to the city, it is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. Most of the expected amenities are available. For instance, there is one mall—not very large but adequate. It takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. These range from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t immediately nearby, it’s easy to drive to any major chain store you’d like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit surprising. Almost every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars a month. Neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. Perhaps it's just the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are pricey, but over the years we've become frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been in storage. You notice smells less as an adult. You might start smoking, or you might just get used to things as they are. But the flea market remains persistent. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It lingers in leather even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, yet inside thrift stores, it's silent. No matter the number of people or cars passing by, the store stays quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people flood in. It's called a developing city. Hosting one of the biggest e-commerce and delivery companies, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and not much is expected of you. You can be quiet and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your shell as long as you want, and the city will move around like waves on a beach. It's an exciting place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, it's less an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. We exchange mail. It's good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern sprawl, but neighbors like mine make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unappealing or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are a bit higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low overall. In the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has only been affected by minor thefts, like items disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources available, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town possesses many positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. He has not experienced any bullying, despite his special needs, thanks to the school’s positive environment, and he loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many visual improvements to our town, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and upgrading city parks. Unfortunately, these enhancements have mostly occurred in the town center and the west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated. The east side, where I live, is often overlooked, causing frustration among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options—both small businesses and larger retail stores—to meet my family's needs. While our home may not hold much value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Located on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater. A block down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. On weekends, particularly in June and July, you can often see people lined up to enter. A few blocks away is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this area of town. The park is bordered by concrete, with tall staircases built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals pitch their tents neatly along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they manage to keep warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish most about my city isn't the beauty of its historical architecture—the tall, proud buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even now, three decades later, stories are told about the federal government and DEA's efforts to clean the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. Stories are still shared across generations, reaching newcomers like me, about those times. Despite being considered one of the tougher areas in the city, residents work hard to maintain it. They care deeply about their community and what happens on their block. There is a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, influenced by outdated social conditioning. Perhaps I blend in enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop views me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism and cultural conditioning that persist in our nation, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valued.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story houses. On warm days or weekends, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the residents. People respect your privacy unless you need assistance. I've ordered numerous packages online, and none have been stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories is from there too when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and enjoy playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now fills me with nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of nearby food options. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are the most popular but are common in most suburbs. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store where you can get ingredients or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories on social media and the news about others' neighbor experiences makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are fun and reasonably priced. One bar recently changed its name and is more expensive, but the service and drinks are decent. The community is friendly, mostly made up of college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments here are affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management placed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings nearby tend to look old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which feels like a rip-off. There's a very cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved, and a gas station across from it that's not reputed to be a great workplace. The road was improved last summer with a new sidewalk and greenery, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps from recent cuts, but it’s more wooded here than down the road. Behind my complex are more apartments, and although I live on 42nd street, 43rd street behind us isn’t as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are many trees on that street, likely to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in my area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, though crime also happens in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make getting to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. They are arranged and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only difference is that each one is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of a random driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing escape from our modern, technology-driven world, almost like going back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. You would have found me in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, staying in the living room, anxious and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the sudden temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun emerged, and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do all the residents, though the interiors vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make much sense to me. I enjoy strolling along the large field behind where I live and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a local farm that brays in the evening to remind us of its presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Given that I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, I suppose I can share my experiences. Initially, I felt quite sad upon moving here. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough, and I even cried because I missed my old friends dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we relocated to a place with better housing and a higher-quality high school—everything was considered more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and encountered some adversaries at school, too. Although I haven't really gotten to know most of my neighbors, I've become acquainted with Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, since they live right next door. They're wonderful people whom I almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding (it was a remarriage) with my family, which was a delightful event. It inspired me to dream of providing my future wife with a queenly life as I build my wealth. I even caught the garter at the wedding, although I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I especially enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great things. The neighborhood feels like a maze, yet with GPS, I'm now more comfortable exploring. I’ve only ventured so far, mostly when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and relish life as much as possible. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and enjoy using my bokken wooden sword. There are basketball and tennis courts here, though I haven’t played in a while. They're available if I decide to revisit those sports. My dad and Mr. Graves introduced my best friend and me to tennis; they pushed us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable times here, and while there are numerous stories I could share, these are the ones that stand out. I truly believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that may not be particularly distinctive among those in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in the agriculture industry. Johnston prides itself on being the Peach Capital of the World, as proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area mainly consists of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses outside the town center are spaced far apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's few stores are situated. There are three options for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. The town's small but pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is where people usually pick up a few items, while most prefer to shop at the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main groceries. The town's most frequented store is Dollar General, bustling from morning to night with its wide selection of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a well-known local woman, has been a fixture in Johnston for many years, offering delivery services through two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service providing daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located away from the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve the Johnston community. Johnston Elementary School is the sole elementary school, with students attending middle and high school in the neighboring town after fifth grade. While there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or pet walking areas, nor a wide array of restaurants, it's a pleasant town that you might easily miss if you blink while passing through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which results in more traffic than I would prefer, but otherwise, the neighborhood is peaceful. Not many residents move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the neighbors. People usually keep busy with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going and recognize the local cars. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles when we see them. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, as you would expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently at the house. There are four of us—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—so others are used to seeing us come and go. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. It seems there's always someone mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawnmower nearly every day from March to October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing lots of shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, feeling more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I like working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host visitors, resulting in extra cars parked around, and it's similar during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the heart of the high desert, where there's an abundance of dirt everywhere. It's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown unless you've lived here. Spotting a lawn means someone is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s, the houses were quite spread out, and while that's still the case, there are many new developments now. Honestly, this area increasingly resembles a city, which is a trend seen in many places. People here are generally friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly people, so it's a pretty nice area. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel elsewhere, as there aren't stores like Whole Foods around. The most common job in my city, though not based on official statistics, seems to be in construction. This is likely because the city is still not very developed, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning for me since I prefer things as they are. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, that's my full-time job; I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The unique climate and terrain have created delicate ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take time to understand these creatures to live together safely. My family and I have adjusted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different ones. We do have some attractions here. For families looking to experience the desert, Victorville offers a unique visit. Try to plan your trip around the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a mix of activities and fun. Also, visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're curious about the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that reflect Victorville's social and industrial development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is likely to be somewhat unusual. While others might answer from the perspective of homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and my dormitory mates are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine has buildings, residents, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 people each. Next, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often rented by alumni. However, these are less common due to their inefficiency. Finally, the dormitories house hundreds of students, usually with two per room, and are the most prevalent housing type here. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood’s population. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dormitories, and older students live in apartments. The character of this neighborhood’s residents is best appreciated in person, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers a wide range of stores along with a single park. The stores provide a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, as well as the school’s unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a communal space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my house is perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers choose to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has several potholes, making driving somewhat risky. Some of the telephone and electric wires in the area look worn out. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often bring down the power lines, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look. However, residents dislike them and try to cut as many as possible because they block the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's beautiful at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange. It's usually cloudy, though, so sunlight is often seen through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, allowing moss to grow on anything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in my area, even though there's a school nearby. Most of my neighbors are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs. It's common to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam the area freely. Some are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most away from our neighborhood. We also have the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide; you can clearly see the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a challenge! The neighborhood is well-served by public transportation, which is a popular choice in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, so you'll still have that quintessential New York City feel. As you explore, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular with locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and the convenience is unmatched. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from each other near my location, which makes accessing groceries very easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asians; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children living here. Most of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds playing and interacting well together. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings, with most structures being co-op or condominium apartments. However, the majority of residences are two-family houses. The residents are generally friendly, but it can be quite noisy. Daily, you'd hear cars blaring music or speeding by, which might wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, stay alert. Although it’s a relatively safe area, unpredictable incidents can occur, such as encountering troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I was once physically assaulted here many years ago, and package theft is also a common issue. Finally, despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, this rule is often ignored in Bensonhurst. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a major annoyance of mine, as dog waste is prevalent throughout the neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, strip club, and only partially adheres to legal boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a city that was less popular and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland maintains its weirdness. Here, \"weird\" doesn't always equate to being accepting but indicates an openness to things typically not embraced. It doesn't mean we lack modern amenities or contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods come from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland has its share of normalcy, with yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Amazingly often, they contain something perfect for a passerby. Typically, they hold clothes and books, but the possibilities are endless. The enchanting possibility of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures what Portland embodies, at least for me. Yet, I’m just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a hub for diverse passions and pursuits. We chase our dreams or dream about them while spending too much time at the bar. It's true that Portland faces a drug issue, which often stems from mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue that remains unsolved. The homeless are attracted by Portland's social services, which surpass those in many regions, yet still fall short, as they do nationwide. The general public oscillates between empathy and animosity. In this regard, Portland is not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the north, observing the sun's rise and set each day. Despite often forgetting them amid the chaos of work and daily life, they remain steadfast and unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, their presence demands my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my anxious spirit, granting me the strength to carry on, day by day. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains captivated me from the start. While the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own right, with numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-driven study sessions. A short walk or bus ride away lies the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an aura of antiquity, revealing the town's bustling energy akin to its urban neighbors. However, this lively atmosphere only stretches a few blocks before the peacefulness of the small town reemerges past the library. This blend of environments in such close proximity gives the city a marvelous vibe, inviting exploration. Here, it's easy to forge cherished memories linked to various parts of town—whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the lively downtown to see a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. Of course, like all places, it also holds some harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or tearful moments during a 2 a.m. existential crisis, which I know all too well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each fulfilling a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate life’s mysteries. I would walk past the pond, through the park and suburban homes, until reaching a main street. At that moment, the sun's brilliant rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky, and I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as always—the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky beyond any building in sight, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—nestled behind a shopping strip in a residential neighborhood, it doesn't seem like a typical place where people would choose to live. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see guests during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a lively community. Here, on these streets, lie several apartment complexes arranged with precision, reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls laid out in a row. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory issues, so we'll steer clear of those—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the neighboring complexes have a distinct character, forming a hidden world unknown to most locals. Across from these complexes, a satellite campus of a community college stands quietly, where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. Iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters grumble about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where patients recover from unfortunate accidents. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Children play in the park, dashing across the grass, while bees hover around the flower beds. Retirees walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the skateboarding teens and nodding politely at the young girls gossiping near the playground. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant offering affordable meals, yet it's never crowded. Adjacent is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can stock up on pool supplies, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once—a testament to the convenience of strip malls. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens from the park often grab a treat to enjoy while showing off skateboarding tricks and vaping, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana—a slice of Southern history where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most homes are single-family, though a few have been converted into duplexes while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like many others, it evokes a not-so-distant past when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, persists in proclaiming to us and visitors alike that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars parked in the driveways, and children play as though their world is all that exists. The public school, which has stood for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire a future in today’s youth while evoking nostalgia among older residents. There are few churches, mostly empty, yet the basketball courts remain busy. Every home looks different, but they share a similar feel. There’s a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many of the neighborhood's residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, the kids lost interest, and it became a pharmacy—since, supposedly, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at a discount, avoiding crowds due to the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders who enjoy a night out at an affordable price, without the kids, of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though the entrance and exit are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would ruin it. The elders eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where different businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, while others include various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. Some stores are large, well-known chains owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular too. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the numerous attractions nearby. There are also a couple of parks close by, which are popular with families and their young children. As for the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is home to people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities. We have areas such as Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city, despite some attractions being nearby, as the city is vast and walking isn’t the preferred mode of travel. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging almost everywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings rising in the city. It seems to be a popular place, but many residents are unhappy about the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment complexes. Residential areas feature houses of different sizes, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, so housing diversity is also present. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It isn’t a close-knit community nowadays, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends of similar age from the neighborhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She came from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her home; she'd never experienced such open space before. As she absorbed the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, the area is alive with newly planted flowers and the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. Driveways showcase high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a welcoming smile. He spends his day mowing the lawn and can often be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he is genuine and has a remarkable past. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my house. In the side yard, geese are often chased by our Terrier. At the back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly meant chasing them, always finding something to do and usually a neighborhood child to play with. Winters in my small town can be harsh yet stunning. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When snow occasionally falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We’d construct massive igloo-like forts to store our ammunition, using branches as an arsenal. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, back when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart or Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to reach any destination. Despite this, I am fortunate to live in one of the most stunning areas of the world, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are readily accessible for a quick dip almost everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren't crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some of which have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many homes have full basements visible from the street, and several feature older aluminum siding. The neighborhood boasts houses in a variety of colors, with most homes having yards. These yards often contain trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who either are or were raising families. On any given day, children run along the streets, and people can be seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize each other, and it's easy to spot newcomers. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. The lawns are well-maintained, without piles of fall leaves, and the green grass is neatly mowed. If there are plants or bushes, they are kept trimmed. This isn't a neighborhood that impresses with grand homes, but it's one where you sense it's an excellent place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it may look average, it stands out because it embodies what many desire—a secure place to come home to each day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff's department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, providing services to locals. Close by are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and players' names. Our small-town airport is adjacent, and you can hear the sounds of small planes taking off and landing while you're inside or outside. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're eager, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburban neighborhood. In my particular area, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’ll see only well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are nearly identical, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you’ll spot small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you’ll notice newly paved roads. Despite the many families living here, the streets are in excellent condition without any potholes. Most houses are single-story, although there are some two-story homes. We don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house as you might expect for single-family homes. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment setup, where residents use a key to access their mailbox, along with two larger lockers for packages. This is also due to the HOA’s focus on uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood has a blend of rural and suburban characteristics. Consequently, there is plenty of space for everything. We have several community pools that are well-maintained and gated for residents' use. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don’t need to visit a park to exercise, as the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mainly consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In relation to the city, it is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. Most of the expected amenities are available. For instance, there is one mall—not very large but adequate. It takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. These range from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t immediately nearby, it’s easy to drive to any major chain store you’d like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit surprising. Almost every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars a month. Neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. Perhaps it's just the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are pricey, but over the years we've become frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been in storage. You notice smells less as an adult. You might start smoking, or you might just get used to things as they are. But the flea market remains persistent. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It lingers in leather even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, yet inside thrift stores, it's silent. No matter the number of people or cars passing by, the store stays quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people flood in. It's called a developing city. Hosting one of the biggest e-commerce and delivery companies, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and not much is expected of you. You can be quiet and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your shell as long as you want, and the city will move around like waves on a beach. It's an exciting place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, it's less an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. We exchange mail. It's good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern sprawl, but neighbors like mine make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unappealing or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are a bit higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low overall. In the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has only been affected by minor thefts, like items disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources available, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town possesses many positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. He has not experienced any bullying, despite his special needs, thanks to the school’s positive environment, and he loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many visual improvements to our town, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and upgrading city parks. Unfortunately, these enhancements have mostly occurred in the town center and the west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated. The east side, where I live, is often overlooked, causing frustration among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options—both small businesses and larger retail stores—to meet my family's needs. While our home may not hold much value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Located on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater. A block down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. On weekends, particularly in June and July, you can often see people lined up to enter. A few blocks away is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this area of town. The park is bordered by concrete, with tall staircases built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals pitch their tents neatly along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they manage to keep warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish most about my city isn't the beauty of its historical architecture—the tall, proud buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even now, three decades later, stories are told about the federal government and DEA's efforts to clean the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. Stories are still shared across generations, reaching newcomers like me, about those times. Despite being considered one of the tougher areas in the city, residents work hard to maintain it. They care deeply about their community and what happens on their block. There is a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, influenced by outdated social conditioning. Perhaps I blend in enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop views me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism and cultural conditioning that persist in our nation, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valued.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story houses. On warm days or weekends, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the residents. People respect your privacy unless you need assistance. I've ordered numerous packages online, and none have been stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories is from there too when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and enjoy playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now fills me with nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of nearby food options. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are the most popular but are common in most suburbs. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store where you can get ingredients or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories on social media and the news about others' neighbor experiences makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are fun and reasonably priced. One bar recently changed its name and is more expensive, but the service and drinks are decent. The community is friendly, mostly made up of college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments here are affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management placed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings nearby tend to look old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which feels like a rip-off. There's a very cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved, and a gas station across from it that's not reputed to be a great workplace. The road was improved last summer with a new sidewalk and greenery, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps from recent cuts, but it’s more wooded here than down the road. Behind my complex are more apartments, and although I live on 42nd street, 43rd street behind us isn’t as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are many trees on that street, likely to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in my area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, though crime also happens in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make getting to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. They are arranged and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only difference is that each one is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of a random driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing escape from our modern, technology-driven world, almost like going back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. You would have found me in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, staying in the living room, anxious and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the sudden temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun emerged, and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do all the residents, though the interiors vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make much sense to me. I enjoy strolling along the large field behind where I live and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a local farm that brays in the evening to remind us of its presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Given that I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, I suppose I can share my experiences. Initially, I felt quite sad upon moving here. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough, and I even cried because I missed my old friends dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we relocated to a place with better housing and a higher-quality high school—everything was considered more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and encountered some adversaries at school, too. Although I haven't really gotten to know most of my neighbors, I've become acquainted with Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, since they live right next door. They're wonderful people whom I almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding (it was a remarriage) with my family, which was a delightful event. It inspired me to dream of providing my future wife with a queenly life as I build my wealth. I even caught the garter at the wedding, although I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I especially enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great things. The neighborhood feels like a maze, yet with GPS, I'm now more comfortable exploring. I’ve only ventured so far, mostly when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and relish life as much as possible. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and enjoy using my bokken wooden sword. There are basketball and tennis courts here, though I haven’t played in a while. They're available if I decide to revisit those sports. My dad and Mr. Graves introduced my best friend and me to tennis; they pushed us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable times here, and while there are numerous stories I could share, these are the ones that stand out. I truly believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that may not be particularly distinctive among those in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in the agriculture industry. Johnston prides itself on being the Peach Capital of the World, as proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area mainly consists of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses outside the town center are spaced far apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's few stores are situated. There are three options for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. The town's small but pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is where people usually pick up a few items, while most prefer to shop at the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main groceries. The town's most frequented store is Dollar General, bustling from morning to night with its wide selection of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a well-known local woman, has been a fixture in Johnston for many years, offering delivery services through two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service providing daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located away from the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve the Johnston community. Johnston Elementary School is the sole elementary school, with students attending middle and high school in the neighboring town after fifth grade. While there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or pet walking areas, nor a wide array of restaurants, it's a pleasant town that you might easily miss if you blink while passing through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which results in more traffic than I would prefer, but otherwise, the neighborhood is peaceful. Not many residents move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the neighbors. People usually keep busy with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going and recognize the local cars. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles when we see them. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, as you would expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently at the house. There are four of us—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—so others are used to seeing us come and go. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. It seems there's always someone mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawnmower nearly every day from March to October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing lots of shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, feeling more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I like working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host visitors, resulting in extra cars parked around, and it's similar during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the heart of the high desert, where there's an abundance of dirt everywhere. It's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown unless you've lived here. Spotting a lawn means someone is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s, the houses were quite spread out, and while that's still the case, there are many new developments now. Honestly, this area increasingly resembles a city, which is a trend seen in many places. People here are generally friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly people, so it's a pretty nice area. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel elsewhere, as there aren't stores like Whole Foods around. The most common job in my city, though not based on official statistics, seems to be in construction. This is likely because the city is still not very developed, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning for me since I prefer things as they are. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, that's my full-time job; I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The unique climate and terrain have created delicate ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take time to understand these creatures to live together safely. My family and I have adjusted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different ones. We do have some attractions here. For families looking to experience the desert, Victorville offers a unique visit. Try to plan your trip around the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a mix of activities and fun. Also, visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're curious about the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that reflect Victorville's social and industrial development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is likely to be somewhat unusual. While others might answer from the perspective of homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and my dormitory mates are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine has buildings, residents, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 people each. Next, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often rented by alumni. However, these are less common due to their inefficiency. Finally, the dormitories house hundreds of students, usually with two per room, and are the most prevalent housing type here. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood’s population. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dormitories, and older students live in apartments. The character of this neighborhood’s residents is best appreciated in person, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers a wide range of stores along with a single park. The stores provide a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, as well as the school’s unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a communal space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my house is perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers choose to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has several potholes, making driving somewhat risky. Some of the telephone and electric wires in the area look worn out. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often bring down the power lines, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look. However, residents dislike them and try to cut as many as possible because they block the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's beautiful at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange. It's usually cloudy, though, so sunlight is often seen through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, allowing moss to grow on anything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in my area, even though there's a school nearby. Most of my neighbors are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs. It's common to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam the area freely. Some are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most away from our neighborhood. We also have the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide; you can clearly see the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a challenge! The neighborhood is well-served by public transportation, which is a popular choice in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, so you'll still have that quintessential New York City feel. As you explore, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular with locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and the convenience is unmatched. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from each other near my location, which makes accessing groceries very easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asians; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children living here. Most of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds playing and interacting well together. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings, with most structures being co-op or condominium apartments. However, the majority of residences are two-family houses. The residents are generally friendly, but it can be quite noisy. Daily, you'd hear cars blaring music or speeding by, which might wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, stay alert. Although it’s a relatively safe area, unpredictable incidents can occur, such as encountering troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I was once physically assaulted here many years ago, and package theft is also a common issue. Finally, despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, this rule is often ignored in Bensonhurst. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a major annoyance of mine, as dog waste is prevalent throughout the neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, strip club, and only partially adheres to legal boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a city that was less popular and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland maintains its weirdness. Here, \"weird\" doesn't always equate to being accepting but indicates an openness to things typically not embraced. It doesn't mean we lack modern amenities or contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods come from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland has its share of normalcy, with yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Amazingly often, they contain something perfect for a passerby. Typically, they hold clothes and books, but the possibilities are endless. The enchanting possibility of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures what Portland embodies, at least for me. Yet, I’m just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a hub for diverse passions and pursuits. We chase our dreams or dream about them while spending too much time at the bar. It's true that Portland faces a drug issue, which often stems from mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue that remains unsolved. The homeless are attracted by Portland's social services, which surpass those in many regions, yet still fall short, as they do nationwide. The general public oscillates between empathy and animosity. In this regard, Portland is not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the north, observing the sun's rise and set each day. Despite often forgetting them amid the chaos of work and daily life, they remain steadfast and unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, their presence demands my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my anxious spirit, granting me the strength to carry on, day by day. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains captivated me from the start. While the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own right, with numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-driven study sessions. A short walk or bus ride away lies the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an aura of antiquity, revealing the town's bustling energy akin to its urban neighbors. However, this lively atmosphere only stretches a few blocks before the peacefulness of the small town reemerges past the library. This blend of environments in such close proximity gives the city a marvelous vibe, inviting exploration. Here, it's easy to forge cherished memories linked to various parts of town—whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the lively downtown to see a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. Of course, like all places, it also holds some harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or tearful moments during a 2 a.m. existential crisis, which I know all too well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each fulfilling a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate life’s mysteries. I would walk past the pond, through the park and suburban homes, until reaching a main street. At that moment, the sun's brilliant rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky, and I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as always—the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky beyond any building in sight, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—nestled behind a shopping strip in a residential neighborhood, it doesn't seem like a typical place where people would choose to live. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see guests during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a lively community. Here, on these streets, lie several apartment complexes arranged with precision, reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls laid out in a row. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory issues, so we'll steer clear of those—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the neighboring complexes have a distinct character, forming a hidden world unknown to most locals. Across from these complexes, a satellite campus of a community college stands quietly, where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. Iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters grumble about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where patients recover from unfortunate accidents. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Children play in the park, dashing across the grass, while bees hover around the flower beds. Retirees walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the skateboarding teens and nodding politely at the young girls gossiping near the playground. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant offering affordable meals, yet it's never crowded. Adjacent is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can stock up on pool supplies, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once—a testament to the convenience of strip malls. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens from the park often grab a treat to enjoy while showing off skateboarding tricks and vaping, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana—a slice of Southern history where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most homes are single-family, though a few have been converted into duplexes while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like many others, it evokes a not-so-distant past when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, persists in proclaiming to us and visitors alike that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars parked in the driveways, and children play as though their world is all that exists. The public school, which has stood for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire a future in today’s youth while evoking nostalgia among older residents. There are few churches, mostly empty, yet the basketball courts remain busy. Every home looks different, but they share a similar feel. There’s a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many of the neighborhood's residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, the kids lost interest, and it became a pharmacy—since, supposedly, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at a discount, avoiding crowds due to the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders who enjoy a night out at an affordable price, without the kids, of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though the entrance and exit are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would ruin it. The elders eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where different businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, while others include various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. Some stores are large, well-known chains owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular too. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the numerous attractions nearby. There are also a couple of parks close by, which are popular with families and their young children. As for the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is home to people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities. We have areas such as Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city, despite some attractions being nearby, as the city is vast and walking isn’t the preferred mode of travel. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging almost everywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings rising in the city. It seems to be a popular place, but many residents are unhappy about the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment complexes. Residential areas feature houses of different sizes, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, so housing diversity is also present. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It isn’t a close-knit community nowadays, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends of similar age from the neighborhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She came from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her home; she'd never experienced such open space before. As she absorbed the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, the area is alive with newly planted flowers and the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. Driveways showcase high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a welcoming smile. He spends his day mowing the lawn and can often be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he is genuine and has a remarkable past. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my house. In the side yard, geese are often chased by our Terrier. At the back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly meant chasing them, always finding something to do and usually a neighborhood child to play with. Winters in my small town can be harsh yet stunning. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When snow occasionally falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We’d construct massive igloo-like forts to store our ammunition, using branches as an arsenal. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, back when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree children."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart or Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to reach any destination. Despite this, I am fortunate to live in one of the most stunning areas of the world, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are readily accessible for a quick dip almost everywhere. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren't crammed together, nor are they identical cookie-cutter designs. They are older homes, some of which have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Many homes have full basements visible from the street, and several feature older aluminum siding. The neighborhood boasts houses in a variety of colors, with most homes having yards. These yards often contain trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who either are or were raising families. On any given day, children run along the streets, and people can be seen walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors recognize each other, and it's easy to spot newcomers. You might see someone grilling and wave hello, or exchange a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away. The lawns are well-maintained, without piles of fall leaves, and the green grass is neatly mowed. If there are plants or bushes, they are kept trimmed. This isn't a neighborhood that impresses with grand homes, but it's one where you sense it's an excellent place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it may look average, it stands out because it embodies what many desire—a secure place to come home to each day. Within walking distance are the county sheriff's department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, providing services to locals. Close by are baseball and softball fields where you can hear announcers calling out scores and players' names. Our small-town airport is adjacent, and you can hear the sounds of small planes taking off and landing while you're inside or outside. You can walk to a local ice cream shop, and if you're eager, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be described as a typical suburban neighborhood. In my particular area, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’ll see only well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are nearly identical, with a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways. Occasionally, you’ll spot small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. Driving through the neighborhood, you’ll notice newly paved roads. Despite the many families living here, the streets are in excellent condition without any potholes. Most houses are single-story, although there are some two-story homes. We don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house as you might expect for single-family homes. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment setup, where residents use a key to access their mailbox, along with two larger lockers for packages. This is also due to the HOA’s focus on uniformity. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so the neighborhood has a blend of rural and suburban characteristics. Consequently, there is plenty of space for everything. We have several community pools that are well-maintained and gated for residents' use. Additionally, there are various walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don’t need to visit a park to exercise, as the neighborhood is large enough for running. The community mainly consists of retired individuals, making it a very safe area where everyone looks out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In relation to the city, it is surprisingly large in terms of population but has a small-town feel. Most of the expected amenities are available. For instance, there is one mall—not very large but adequate. It takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. These range from high-end grocery stores with organic options to bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical, with amenities like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t immediately nearby, it’s easy to drive to any major chain store you’d like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons. It was a bit surprising. Almost every apartment in the area costs over a thousand dollars a month. Neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. Perhaps it's just the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are pricey, but over the years we've become frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty scent of flea market toys and clothes that have been in storage. You notice smells less as an adult. You might start smoking, or you might just get used to things as they are. But the flea market remains persistent. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It lingers in leather even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, yet inside thrift stores, it's silent. No matter the number of people or cars passing by, the store stays quiet. It's a pleasant place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more cars and people flood in. It's called a developing city. Hosting one of the biggest e-commerce and delivery companies, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals, and not much is expected of you. You can be quiet and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your shell as long as you want, and the city will move around like waves on a beach. It's an exciting place. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a way, it's less an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food, and they do the same. We exchange mail. It's good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a vast, impersonal modern sprawl, but neighbors like mine make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the town's east side, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property values are low, with most homes being rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unappealing or unpleasant. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly, often offering smiles and greetings as I walk by. Although crime rates are a bit higher here compared to other parts of town, they remain relatively low overall. In the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has only been affected by minor thefts, like items disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic,\" which has claimed many lives due to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, there are numerous resources available, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the families and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town possesses many positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. He has not experienced any bullying, despite his special needs, thanks to the school’s positive environment, and he loves attending. We have an active PTO that organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and educational advancement. With over 20% of the town's population living below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school fees, supplies, and field trip costs are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many visual improvements to our town, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and upgrading city parks. Unfortunately, these enhancements have mostly occurred in the town center and the west side, where the shopping areas and most traffic are concentrated. The east side, where I live, is often overlooked, causing frustration among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally kind, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options—both small businesses and larger retail stores—to meet my family's needs. While our home may not hold much value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. Located on a hill, it's surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater. A block down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts diverse crowds on warm summer evenings. On weekends, particularly in June and July, you can often see people lined up to enter. A few blocks away is the nearest city park, which is quite large for this area of town. The park is bordered by concrete, with tall staircases built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals pitch their tents neatly along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, the heavy rains in mid-winter make it hard to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they manage to keep warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I cherish most about my city isn't the beauty of its historical architecture—the tall, proud buildings that dot the hills leading down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even now, three decades later, stories are told about the federal government and DEA's efforts to clean the streets. The community hasn't forgotten. Stories are still shared across generations, reaching newcomers like me, about those times. Despite being considered one of the tougher areas in the city, residents work hard to maintain it. They care deeply about their community and what happens on their block. There is a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, influenced by outdated social conditioning. Perhaps I blend in enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop views me as one of their own, someone who understands the reminders of racism and cultural conditioning that persist in our nation, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when caught in the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valued.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, it was challenging to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone living two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them lives here anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story houses. On warm days or weekends, I often hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet during the week, and I've never had any issues with the residents. People respect your privacy unless you need assistance. I've ordered numerous packages online, and none have been stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house, where I've made many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. One of my worst memories is from there too when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and enjoy playing on the swings and slides. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park now fills me with nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of nearby food options. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food places are the most popular but are common in most suburbs. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like an Indian-owned store where you can get ingredients or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing horror stories on social media and the news about others' neighbor experiences makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it's close to the college I attend. The area mostly consists of apartment buildings, with a few restaurants and bars that are fun and reasonably priced. One bar recently changed its name and is more expensive, but the service and drinks are decent. The community is friendly, mostly made up of college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments here are affordable. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors and prefer it that way; they smoke a lot of weed, so the building management placed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. The buildings nearby tend to look old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they were poorly constructed yet have high rents, which feels like a rip-off. There's a very cheap restaurant nearby that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved, and a gas station across from it that's not reputed to be a great workplace. The road was improved last summer with a new sidewalk and greenery, making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps from recent cuts, but it’s more wooded here than down the road. Behind my complex are more apartments, and although I live on 42nd street, 43rd street behind us isn’t as nice, with deteriorating sidewalks and shabby buildings. There are many trees on that street, likely to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in my area occurs at an apartment complex on that street, though crime also happens in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Despite this, I like living here because it's affordable and has useful amenities. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make getting to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. They are arranged and spaced in such a way that they resemble individual homes. The only difference is that each one is painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of a random driveway to chat while the neighborhood children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing escape from our modern, technology-driven world, almost like going back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The only downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. You would have found me in my bathtub, holding my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, staying in the living room, anxious and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming due to the sudden temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. When I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun emerged, and it started to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family, who were just as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed with moms and kids outside while dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do all the residents, though the interiors vary in size. Some are quite small, which doesn't make much sense to me. I enjoy strolling along the large field behind where I live and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey at a local farm that brays in the evening to remind us of its presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Given that I've been in this neighborhood for about a decade, I suppose I can share my experiences. Initially, I felt quite sad upon moving here. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough, and I even cried because I missed my old friends dearly. However, my parents wanted the best for me and my younger sister, so we relocated to a place with better housing and a higher-quality high school—everything was considered more upscale. Over time, I adjusted, made new friends, and encountered some adversaries at school, too. Although I haven't really gotten to know most of my neighbors, I've become acquainted with Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, since they live right next door. They're wonderful people whom I almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding (it was a remarriage) with my family, which was a delightful event. It inspired me to dream of providing my future wife with a queenly life as I build my wealth. I even caught the garter at the wedding, although I missed the bouquet! We danced the night away, and I especially enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii. I haven't seen her since, but I hope she's doing great things. The neighborhood feels like a maze, yet with GPS, I'm now more comfortable exploring. I’ve only ventured so far, mostly when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and relish life as much as possible. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and enjoy using my bokken wooden sword. There are basketball and tennis courts here, though I haven’t played in a while. They're available if I decide to revisit those sports. My dad and Mr. Graves introduced my best friend and me to tennis; they pushed us hard, but it was always enjoyable. I've had many memorable times here, and while there are numerous stories I could share, these are the ones that stand out. I truly believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town that may not be particularly distinctive among those in South Carolina, but it plays a crucial role in the agriculture industry. Johnston prides itself on being the Peach Capital of the World, as proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area mainly consists of farmland, with peach orchards and cattle dominating the landscape. Houses outside the town center are spaced far apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are often set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's few stores are situated. There are three options for \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once existed but closed recently. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. The town's small but pricey grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is where people usually pick up a few items, while most prefer to shop at the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main groceries. The town's most frequented store is Dollar General, bustling from morning to night with its wide selection of everyday items. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a well-known local woman, has been a fixture in Johnston for many years, offering delivery services through two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a small pet grooming service providing daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located away from the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve the Johnston community. Johnston Elementary School is the sole elementary school, with students attending middle and high school in the neighboring town after fifth grade. While there are technically no parks, a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. Although there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or pet walking areas, nor a wide array of restaurants, it's a pleasant town that you might easily miss if you blink while passing through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, which results in more traffic than I would prefer, but otherwise, the neighborhood is peaceful. Not many residents move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the neighbors. People usually keep busy with yard work and other everyday tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, allowing us to see everyone coming and going and recognize the local cars. We take note of unfamiliar vehicles when we see them. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes, as you would expect. Since we work from home, we're frequently at the house. There are four of us—myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—so others are used to seeing us come and go. We often play outside, even in the rain, and occasionally grill on our back deck, filling the air with the pleasant aroma of barbecue. It seems there's always someone mowing the lawn, and you can hear a lawnmower nearly every day from March to October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was originally a forested area, providing lots of shade but also a lot of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn leaves annually, and I enjoy the smell of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winters have been mild, feeling more like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I like working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host visitors, resulting in extra cars parked around, and it's similar during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. It would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the heart of the high desert, where there's an abundance of dirt everywhere. It's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown unless you've lived here. Spotting a lawn means someone is spending a lot on its upkeep. Back in the 90s, the houses were quite spread out, and while that's still the case, there are many new developments now. Honestly, this area increasingly resembles a city, which is a trend seen in many places. People here are generally friendly, but like any city, there are good and bad areas. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly people, so it's a pretty nice area. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel elsewhere, as there aren't stores like Whole Foods around. The most common job in my city, though not based on official statistics, seems to be in construction. This is likely because the city is still not very developed, with plenty of open space for building, which is a bit concerning for me since I prefer things as they are. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, that's my full-time job; I install drywall and T-bars. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The unique climate and terrain have created delicate ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take time to understand these creatures to live together safely. My family and I have adjusted well to the wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert bugs, and as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different ones. We do have some attractions here. For families looking to experience the desert, Victorville offers a unique visit. Try to plan your trip around the annual San Bernardino County Fair for a mix of activities and fun. Also, visit nearby Wrightwood for snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. If you're curious about the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum has geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that reflect Victorville's social and industrial development.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response is likely to be somewhat unusual. While others might answer from the perspective of homeowners with their distinct lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and my dormitory mates are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine has buildings, residents, shops, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. In the apartments, typically 2-4 people share a room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor, and most buildings have two floors, accommodating around 20 people each. Next, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often rented by alumni. However, these are less common due to their inefficiency. Finally, the dormitories house hundreds of students, usually with two per room, and are the most prevalent housing type here. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood’s population. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dormitories, and older students live in apartments. The character of this neighborhood’s residents is best appreciated in person, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it offers a wide range of stores along with a single park. The stores provide a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, as well as the school’s unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's limits! Additionally, the park serves as a communal space for all the diverse residents, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "Sidewalks are scarce in my area. Everything slopes downward, and my house is perched atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. Locals refer to it as the \"work out hill\" because many joggers choose to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has several potholes, making driving somewhat risky. Some of the telephone and electric wires in the area look worn out. Due to frequent rain and storms, branches and debris often bring down the power lines, leading to constant repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look. However, residents dislike them and try to cut as many as possible because they block the ocean view. This is why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. It's beautiful at sunset when the water appears to glow from below and the sky turns orange. It's usually cloudy, though, so sunlight is often seen through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, allowing moss to grow on anything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furry with moss, taking three hours to clean. There aren't many children in my area, even though there's a school nearby. Most of my neighbors are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs. It's common to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might sneak into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam the area freely. Some are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them and have driven most away from our neighborhood. We also have the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle that gets chased away by neighborhood crows. There are no stores nearby, but if you walk downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide; you can clearly see the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a challenge! The neighborhood is well-served by public transportation, which is a popular choice in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, so you'll still have that quintessential New York City feel. As you explore, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores. Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular with locals because the supermarkets offer excellent quality food at lower prices, and the convenience is unmatched. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from each other near my location, which makes accessing groceries very easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asians; it's quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children living here. Most of the prominent businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer enjoyment. Given that this is New York City, the parks are very diverse, with people from all backgrounds playing and interacting well together. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings, with most structures being co-op or condominium apartments. However, the majority of residences are two-family houses. The residents are generally friendly, but it can be quite noisy. Daily, you'd hear cars blaring music or speeding by, which might wake you up in the morning. If you're visiting at night, stay alert. Although it’s a relatively safe area, unpredictable incidents can occur, such as encountering troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I was once physically assaulted here many years ago, and package theft is also a common issue. Finally, despite fines for not cleaning up after dogs in New York City, this rule is often ignored in Bensonhurst. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a major annoyance of mine, as dog waste is prevalent throughout the neighborhood. Be cautious and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, strip club, and only partially adheres to legal boundaries, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the 90s and early 2000s—a city that was less popular and more affordable, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland maintains its weirdness. Here, \"weird\" doesn't always equate to being accepting but indicates an openness to things typically not embraced. It doesn't mean we lack modern amenities or contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods come from China. There are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, yet Portland has its share of normalcy, with yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, and many others in Portland, you'll find vibrant houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and veggies lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Amazingly often, they contain something perfect for a passerby. Typically, they hold clothes and books, but the possibilities are endless. The enchanting possibility of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures what Portland embodies, at least for me. Yet, I’m just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with goats) or Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a hub for diverse passions and pursuits. We chase our dreams or dream about them while spending too much time at the bar. It's true that Portland faces a drug issue, which often stems from mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. There's also a homelessness issue that remains unsolved. The homeless are attracted by Portland's social services, which surpass those in many regions, yet still fall short, as they do nationwide. The general public oscillates between empathy and animosity. In this regard, Portland is not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the north, observing the sun's rise and set each day. Despite often forgetting them amid the chaos of work and daily life, they remain steadfast and unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, their presence demands my attention, and when I turn to them, they offer solace to my anxious spirit, granting me the strength to carry on, day by day. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, the northern mountains captivated me from the start. While the university boasts its own stunning sights in its architecture, ponds, and trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is charming in its own right, with numerous cafés that hosted many hours of caffeine-driven study sessions. A short walk or bus ride away lies the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings create an aura of antiquity, revealing the town's bustling energy akin to its urban neighbors. However, this lively atmosphere only stretches a few blocks before the peacefulness of the small town reemerges past the library. This blend of environments in such close proximity gives the city a marvelous vibe, inviting exploration. Here, it's easy to forge cherished memories linked to various parts of town—whether it’s strolling past rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or dashing through the lively downtown to see a movie at the fancy theater, courtesy of university tickets. Of course, like all places, it also holds some harsh memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or tearful moments during a 2 a.m. existential crisis, which I know all too well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each fulfilling a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate life’s mysteries. I would walk past the pond, through the park and suburban homes, until reaching a main street. At that moment, the sun's brilliant rays illuminated the palm trees, painting the sky, and I realized I was heading north. There they stood, as always—the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky beyond any building in sight, silently inspiring my sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—nestled behind a shopping strip in a residential neighborhood, it doesn't seem like a typical place where people would choose to live. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and the hotels that only see guests during family reunions in the summer, you'll discover a lively community. Here, on these streets, lie several apartment complexes arranged with precision, reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls laid out in a row. The initial apartments you encounter have been in the news for some unsavory issues, so we'll steer clear of those—appearances can be misleading, after all. However, the neighboring complexes have a distinct character, forming a hidden world unknown to most locals. Across from these complexes, a satellite campus of a community college stands quietly, where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their day. Iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters grumble about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center on the other, where patients recover from unfortunate accidents. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Children play in the park, dashing across the grass, while bees hover around the flower beds. Retirees walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the skateboarding teens and nodding politely at the young girls gossiping near the playground. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant offering affordable meals, yet it's never crowded. Adjacent is a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You can stock up on pool supplies, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all at once—a testament to the convenience of strip malls. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens from the park often grab a treat to enjoy while showing off skateboarding tricks and vaping, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana—a slice of Southern history where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is quite fascinating. Most homes are single-family, though a few have been converted into duplexes while still being connected, if that makes sense. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like many others, it evokes a not-so-distant past when suburban living was the epitome of the American dream. This dream once seemed to warmly embrace the nation, but now it feels like it's slipping away. However, my neighborhood, along with many others, persists in proclaiming to us and visitors alike that the dream is still alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. People aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars parked in the driveways, and children play as though their world is all that exists. The public school, which has stood for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire a future in today’s youth while evoking nostalgia among older residents. There are few churches, mostly empty, yet the basketball courts remain busy. Every home looks different, but they share a similar feel. There’s a large supermarket called Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, and kids often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many of the neighborhood's residents have lived here for generations, each with stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, the kids lost interest, and it became a pharmacy—since, supposedly, drugs solve everything. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at a discount, avoiding crowds due to the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders who enjoy a night out at an affordable price, without the kids, of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though the entrance and exit are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition for an exit in our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would ruin it. The elders eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is highly diverse. Residential areas are scattered among commercial zones, where different businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, while others include various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. Some stores are large, well-known chains owned by big corporations, but small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular too. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful if not for the numerous attractions nearby. There are also a couple of parks close by, which are popular with families and their young children. As for the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and groups of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city is home to people of various races and backgrounds, often residing in their own distinct communities. We have areas such as Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can take a long time to drive due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in my city, despite some attractions being nearby, as the city is vast and walking isn’t the preferred mode of travel. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is challenging almost everywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings rising in the city. It seems to be a popular place, but many residents are unhappy about the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment complexes. Residential areas feature houses of different sizes, along with smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes, even within my immediate neighborhood, so housing diversity is also present. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It isn’t a close-knit community nowadays, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends of similar age from the neighborhood.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast openness. She came from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her home; she'd never experienced such open space before. As she absorbed the endless cornfields, I explained what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you’ll come across a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the small development where I live. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take pride in maintaining. In spring, the area is alive with newly planted flowers and the midwestern trees that change with the seasons. Driveways showcase high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. As we approach my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a welcoming smile. He spends his day mowing the lawn and can often be heard singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he is genuine and has a remarkable past. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my house. In the side yard, geese are often chased by our Terrier. At the back, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly meant chasing them, always finding something to do and usually a neighborhood child to play with. Winters in my small town can be harsh yet stunning. The yard transforms from a lush green to a barren wilderness. Trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become bare skeletons of bark. When snow occasionally falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is decorated with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen weapons. We’d construct massive igloo-like forts to store our ammunition, using branches as an arsenal. In our little wonderland, we played pretend, back when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree children."
