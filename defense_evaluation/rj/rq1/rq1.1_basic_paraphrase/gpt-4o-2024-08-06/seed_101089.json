            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small Michigan town where farmland transitions into quaint tourist spots. There aren't any large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To reach any destination, driving is necessary. Nevertheless, I live in one of the world's most picturesque locations, surrounded by water. My town is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, offering places to wade in. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren’t densely packed or identical. They are older, with some being renovated while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements visible from the street. Many houses have older aluminum siding and are painted in a variety of colors. Yards are common, often equipped with trampolines and playsets, and some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have done so. Children are often seen playing in the streets, and it's usual to see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, and it's easy to identify those who belong. You might see someone grilling and wave, or smile at a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-kept, without piles of leaves from fall, and the grass is neatly trimmed. If there are plants and shrubs, they are maintained. The neighborhood may not be visually striking with impressive homes, but it feels like a good place for raising a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. Its average appearance belies its exceptional nature as it offers the safety people desire at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there’s the county sheriff’s department and jail, and the health department is nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving locals and visitors alike. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Next to these is our small town airport, where you can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing. You can stroll to the local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, you can walk downtown from our neighborhood. My children can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a standard, uniform suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, maintained thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, occasionally dotted with small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved concrete roads that are in excellent condition, with no potholes despite the many families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment complex, where each resident uses a key to access their mailbox. Two larger lockers are available for packages. This uniformity is another product of the HOA. My house is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making the neighborhood part rural, part suburban. This provides plenty of space for various amenities, including multiple community pools that residents can access, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is large enough to run around for a good workout. Most residents are retired, creating a safe community where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel, offering most of the amenities one would expect. For instance, there is one mall, not very big but sufficient. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to any significant location, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t right next door, a short drive provides access to any major chain store.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons, which caught me off guard. In this area, most apartments were priced over a thousand dollars a month, yet neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. It might be due to the challenges we face. Some of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Despite the high costs, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored for a long time. Adult life carries fewer scents. You might pick up smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market's aroma is always present. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after it's washed. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. You can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you start at one end. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. Despite the traffic and crowds outside, the stores remain silent, making them a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood the area. It's regarded as a developing city, housing one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own goals and doesn’t demand much from others. You can be solitary and independent, and nobody will bother you. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of care, here, people don't intrude on your life. You can maintain your privacy, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a beach. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, we have more of a community of friends than just a group of strangers in an apartment. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, attend funerals, and help when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail, and it's nice to see them. I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, it’s the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town located just beyond the suburbs of a large city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amiable, often smiling and greeting me as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes nearby, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, my family has only been indirectly affected by crime, such as minor thefts from our porch when we forget to secure items. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, numerous resources are available to address this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those battling addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite his special needs, he has not experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he loves. We have an active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to encourage family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is marginalized due to financial constraints, and the costs for school-related expenses are quite reasonable. The City Council has made several improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most enhancements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heaviest. The east side, where I live, often gets overlooked, which is a source of frustration for residents. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for more than 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and a block down the hill is a trendy little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there's a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete with tall steps embedded in the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents neatly along the sidewalk and steps. It doesn't snow much, but the heavy rains in mid-winter often make it hard to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic beauty—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I truly love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The people remember, passing down these tales from generation to generation, including to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents work hard to maintain it. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past and is shaped by social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born of ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close with a neighbor who lived two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them resides there anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, featuring many two-story homes. On weekends or whenever the weather is warm, I can hear kids playing outside. The area is generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the people here. In this neighborhood, you're left alone unless you seek assistance. I've ordered several packages online and none have been stolen from my porch, which gives me a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is just a minute or two from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other local guys. One of my worst memories is also from there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just mentioning a trip to the park excites them. The park now brings back many nostalgic memories for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, offering a wide range of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now prefer using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast-food places are the most popular, but these are common in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a popular chain in the Midwest. Some stores also reflect the neighborhood's diversity, like an Indian-owned store for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it’s close to the college I attend. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to visit. One of the bars recently changed its name and it’s a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks is decent. The community is mostly friendly, comprised of college students and lower-income residents, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children in the area because there's an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. Although I don't know my neighbors and don't wish to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener outside their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings around me generally look old but might have renovated interiors. A bit further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they are poorly constructed yet have high rent, which feels like a scam due to their proximity to campus. There’s a very cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, which is reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the road was improved last summer thanks to city funding, adding a big sidewalk and grassy areas, making it a bit nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but the street behind, 43rd Street, isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are deteriorating, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to obscure the building's appearance. Most of the crime occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but even the apartments across from me have their share of crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It’s affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university’s proximity and the two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. These homes are spaced in such a way that they resemble standalone houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friends, and in the evenings, we gather at random driveways to chat while the children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing contrast to our modern, technology-driven world, reminiscent of a bygone era. We are surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, stayed in the living room, uneasy and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the abrupt temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm. Then, life returned to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but despite the identical exteriors, the interiors vary, with some being quite small, which I find puzzling. I enjoy walking in the large field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite upset moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved ones. However, my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a neighborhood with better housing and schools, described as \"not ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends, and even a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, both living next door. They’ve been wonderful and almost feel like family, for which I’m grateful. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family (he remarried), which was a delightful event. I aspire to have a similar celebration one day, to provide a royal life for my future wife. At the wedding, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced all night, especially enjoying the company of Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is quite confusing but with GPS, I explore more, mostly with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games together and enjoy life. Sometimes, I’d go to the park to relax in nature, which brings me peace. I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken sword for fun. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast despite the tough training. Reflecting on my time in this neighborhood, I’ve had many enjoyable experiences and look forward to more great memories.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It might blend in with other towns in South Carolina, but it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly refers to itself as the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The area is mainly farmland, filled with peach trees and cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are usually set back from the road to allow the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are found. For \"fast food,\" there are three options: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to operate here but has recently closed. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, so many locals prefer traveling to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger grocery runs. Dollar General is the most frequented store, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with customers from opening to closing. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a well-known local woman and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Connected to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and after fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Currently, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more family outings and attract potential residents. Though options for entertainment like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and playgrounds are lacking, it's a pleasant town that one might easily pass by without noticing due to its small size.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, but aside from that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the residents. People generally occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, allowing us to observe the comings and goings of the neighborhood and become acquainted with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we tend to notice it. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids often ride their bikes, which is pretty typical around here. Since we work from home, my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and I are frequently at home. Consequently, the neighbors are also accustomed to seeing us around. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, with the sound of lawnmowers almost daily from March until about October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was once a wooded area, providing a lot of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a pleasant signal of fall's arrival. Recently, we've experienced mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's the same for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt everywhere. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown, and when you spot a lawn, you realize that person is likely spending a lot on maintenance. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were few and far between. Nowadays, it's still quite similar, except there are many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to look more like a city every day, but I suppose many areas are evolving in the same way. Most of the people here are very friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly older folks, which makes it a nicer area. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel since stores like Whole Foods are scarce. The most common jobs, as far as I can tell without official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because there's still a lot of undeveloped land here, with plenty of room to build. That worries me a bit because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field; I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, especially the stark beauty of the desert. The high desert's climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these animals to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun in true Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my perspective is somewhat distinct. Unlike most respondents who are likely homeowners with separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory serving as my community. I also consider the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. There are three types of housing nearby: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common building type generally has 2 floors, housing around 20 people per building. Second, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are few since they are less efficient. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms house hundreds of students, with usually two people sharing a room, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while newer students stay in dormitory housing, and older students opt for apartment-style living. It's hard to do justice to the people here with words alone, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Hence, everything needed is available within my neighborhood! Moreover, the park serves as a playground for the diverse populace, kept clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downward, with my house perched atop the steepest hill locally known as the \"work out hill\" due to the joggers who tackle it during their exercise routines. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk directly on the road, which is rough and sometimes feels risky to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the area appear worn and patched. Frequent rain and storms knock down branches and debris onto the power lines, resulting in frequent repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but locals dislike them because they block ocean views. Consequently, many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The sunset is stunning when the water seems illuminated beneath an orange sky, although clouds usually obscure the sun, leaving most days gray and damp. Moss thrives everywhere, covering roofs, cars, and railings. Once, when I left my car outside for a month, it turned green with moss, and cleaning it took three hours. Children are few despite a nearby school; the neighborhood mostly consists of older, often retired residents who prefer dogs over kids. It's typical to see dogs playing on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and they sometimes sneak into open homes. I once had to escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers locally. The area hosts various birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles, which the local crows usually chase away. There are no nearby stores, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a beach, but the rocks are fun to toss into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still experience the typical New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, particularly supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are very popular with locals, offering excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are conveniently located. Near my location, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, enhancing grocery shopping convenience. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most major and popular local businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't have many large corporate buildings, mostly offering co-op living or condominium apartments, with two-family houses being predominant. The residents are generally friendly but can be quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or revving engines that can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault in the past, although it was years ago. A recent issue has been package theft, which is common here. Despite New York City's fines for not cleaning up after pets, many here disregard the rules. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your route to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is dog waste scattered around the neighborhood. Be cautious and watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial town motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the '90s and early 2000s, a less famous and costly city fostering creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does embrace what is usually unaccepted. It doesn't mean lacking modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of America, we buy much of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps weirdness means we simply don't take it all too seriously. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, contain items someone no longer wants, often holding a perfect treasure for a passerby. They frequently have clothes and books but can contain anything. The enchanting possibility of finding something special in a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland for me, though I'm just one of many varieties of weirdness here. Some residents would never consider selecting their attire from a box on the sidewalk. These folks might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is filled with people passionate about diverse interests. Here, people chase dreams or dream of chasing them while spending too much time at bars. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. At its core, like many drug problems, it ties back to mental health, with the persistent rain and gloomy clouds contributing factors. Portland also faces homelessness, a challenge without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by the city's relatively superior social services, though still inadequate like elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we aren't weird at all.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, witnessing the sun's rise and fall every day from the north. Even when I become preoccupied with work and life and forget about them, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they demand my attention, offering solace and strength to help me carry on, day by day. When I began my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to these northern mountains near the campus. While the university boasts its own scenic beauty with its architecture, ponds, and trees, it is the mountains that truly captivate me. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés where I've spent countless hours studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown reveals a historic atmosphere with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices, giving the town a lively energy akin to its neighboring city. However, this urban vibe is fleeting, as one can retreat to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments creates a unique allure, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories, whether it's strolling through a park after an all-nighter with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like everywhere, it holds difficult memories too. The ponds, in particular, serve as places for reflection and midnight soul-searching during existential crises, which I've experienced more than once. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects, each living with purpose, I often ponder my own role in life. Walking past the pond, park, and suburban houses, I eventually reach a main street, where the sun illuminates the palm trees and paints the sky. Looking at the sunrise, I realize I'm heading north. There, as always, stand the mountains, rising above the hazy sky more prominently than any building, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—being a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, it doesn’t seem like a typical place to find homes. Not the kind most people would choose, anyway. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue beyond the hotels, mostly filled during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. In this neighborhood, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes, arranged like meticulously separated Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you encounter has been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we’ll skip over it—appearances can be misleading. However, the apartments adjacent to it, and the next two complexes, belong to a different world unknown to most locals. Opposite these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students, coffee in hand, arrive at 7 a.m., still sleepy. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while drivers shake their fists out of frustration at the traffic they cause on busier days. The road intersects another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along a path, frowning at skateboarding teens and nodding politely to girls chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Next to the park in a strip mall, there's a sushi restaurant with affordable prices, though rarely crowded—a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. It's possible to prepare your pool for summer while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens frequent with cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it’s cool. This neighborhood embodies Americana—a glimpse of history in the sleepy South, where change is rare, and time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood holds a unique charm. Most homes are single-family residences, but a few have been divided into two connected units. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it evokes a bygone era when suburban living epitomized the American dream—a dream that once embraced the nation but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, neighborhoods like mine endure, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream persists, even if we cling to it less confidently. People aren't as hopeful as before, and the little yards aren't as well-kept, but you still find a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if their world is the only one that exists. The nearly 90-year-old public school still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home looks different but shares a similar feel. A large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family—possibly the only Arab family in the area—serves the community, which is predominantly African American. The wide streets often host kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the decline in popularity of karate-themed movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, as if medication is the solution to everything, or so they say. A small movie theater shows classic films at a reduced rate, drawing older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out, minus the kids. An expressway runs through town, though the entry and exit are in the neighboring town. There was an attempt to secure an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed it would spoil the town's character. In the end, the elders convinced the city council to decline the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, where various businesses operate. These businesses include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. While some stores are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and peaceful, if not for the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks nearby that are popular for families with young children. Regarding the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a compact area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, although they often form their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can result in a lengthy drive. Driving just 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. In my city, most people don’t walk to their destinations. Despite some places being nearby, the city is large, and walking isn't a common choice. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking can be challenging almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been significant development in recent years, with large apartment buildings popping up. The city is a popular place to live, but many residents worry about more people moving in and adding more cars to the roads. There are many types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives in or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas feature houses of various sizes and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even in my immediate neighborhood, so there is a variety of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors well. It’s not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast, open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home and had never experienced so much open space. As she marveled at the abundance of cornfields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down the two-lane country road, you'll come upon a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the modest development where I live. Most houses are made of brick and stucco, each boasting at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, shimmering under the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we continue toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum with song. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he's genuine, with an intriguing past. Though he's grown older and lost some sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese scatter as our Terrier chases them. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the gentle stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them. There was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. Winters in my small town can be harsh but breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange blooms become skeletal. When it snows, a winter wonderland emerges overnight. The backyard is dotted with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In this winter wonderland, we played make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree young kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small Michigan town where farmland transitions into quaint tourist spots. There aren't any large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To reach any destination, driving is necessary. Nevertheless, I live in one of the world's most picturesque locations, surrounded by water. My town is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, offering places to wade in. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren’t densely packed or identical. They are older, with some being renovated while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements visible from the street. Many houses have older aluminum siding and are painted in a variety of colors. Yards are common, often equipped with trampolines and playsets, and some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have done so. Children are often seen playing in the streets, and it's usual to see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, and it's easy to identify those who belong. You might see someone grilling and wave, or smile at a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-kept, without piles of leaves from fall, and the grass is neatly trimmed. If there are plants and shrubs, they are maintained. The neighborhood may not be visually striking with impressive homes, but it feels like a good place for raising a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. Its average appearance belies its exceptional nature as it offers the safety people desire at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there’s the county sheriff’s department and jail, and the health department is nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving locals and visitors alike. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Next to these is our small town airport, where you can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing. You can stroll to the local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, you can walk downtown from our neighborhood. My children can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a standard, uniform suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, maintained thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, occasionally dotted with small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved concrete roads that are in excellent condition, with no potholes despite the many families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment complex, where each resident uses a key to access their mailbox. Two larger lockers are available for packages. This uniformity is another product of the HOA. My house is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making the neighborhood part rural, part suburban. This provides plenty of space for various amenities, including multiple community pools that residents can access, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is large enough to run around for a good workout. Most residents are retired, creating a safe community where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel, offering most of the amenities one would expect. For instance, there is one mall, not very big but sufficient. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to any significant location, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t right next door, a short drive provides access to any major chain store.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons, which caught me off guard. In this area, most apartments were priced over a thousand dollars a month, yet neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. It might be due to the challenges we face. Some of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Despite the high costs, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored for a long time. Adult life carries fewer scents. You might pick up smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market's aroma is always present. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after it's washed. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. You can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you start at one end. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. Despite the traffic and crowds outside, the stores remain silent, making them a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood the area. It's regarded as a developing city, housing one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own goals and doesn’t demand much from others. You can be solitary and independent, and nobody will bother you. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of care, here, people don't intrude on your life. You can maintain your privacy, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a beach. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, we have more of a community of friends than just a group of strangers in an apartment. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, attend funerals, and help when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail, and it's nice to see them. I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, it’s the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town located just beyond the suburbs of a large city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amiable, often smiling and greeting me as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes nearby, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, my family has only been indirectly affected by crime, such as minor thefts from our porch when we forget to secure items. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, numerous resources are available to address this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those battling addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite his special needs, he has not experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he loves. We have an active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to encourage family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is marginalized due to financial constraints, and the costs for school-related expenses are quite reasonable. The City Council has made several improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most enhancements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heaviest. The east side, where I live, often gets overlooked, which is a source of frustration for residents. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for more than 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and a block down the hill is a trendy little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there's a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete with tall steps embedded in the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents neatly along the sidewalk and steps. It doesn't snow much, but the heavy rains in mid-winter often make it hard to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic beauty—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I truly love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The people remember, passing down these tales from generation to generation, including to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents work hard to maintain it. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past and is shaped by social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born of ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close with a neighbor who lived two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them resides there anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, featuring many two-story homes. On weekends or whenever the weather is warm, I can hear kids playing outside. The area is generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the people here. In this neighborhood, you're left alone unless you seek assistance. I've ordered several packages online and none have been stolen from my porch, which gives me a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is just a minute or two from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other local guys. One of my worst memories is also from there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just mentioning a trip to the park excites them. The park now brings back many nostalgic memories for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, offering a wide range of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now prefer using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast-food places are the most popular, but these are common in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a popular chain in the Midwest. Some stores also reflect the neighborhood's diversity, like an Indian-owned store for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it’s close to the college I attend. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to visit. One of the bars recently changed its name and it’s a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks is decent. The community is mostly friendly, comprised of college students and lower-income residents, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children in the area because there's an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. Although I don't know my neighbors and don't wish to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener outside their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings around me generally look old but might have renovated interiors. A bit further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they are poorly constructed yet have high rent, which feels like a scam due to their proximity to campus. There’s a very cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, which is reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the road was improved last summer thanks to city funding, adding a big sidewalk and grassy areas, making it a bit nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but the street behind, 43rd Street, isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are deteriorating, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to obscure the building's appearance. Most of the crime occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but even the apartments across from me have their share of crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It’s affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university’s proximity and the two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. These homes are spaced in such a way that they resemble standalone houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friends, and in the evenings, we gather at random driveways to chat while the children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing contrast to our modern, technology-driven world, reminiscent of a bygone era. We are surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, stayed in the living room, uneasy and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the abrupt temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm. Then, life returned to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but despite the identical exteriors, the interiors vary, with some being quite small, which I find puzzling. I enjoy walking in the large field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite upset moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved ones. However, my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a neighborhood with better housing and schools, described as \"not ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends, and even a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, both living next door. They’ve been wonderful and almost feel like family, for which I’m grateful. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family (he remarried), which was a delightful event. I aspire to have a similar celebration one day, to provide a royal life for my future wife. At the wedding, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced all night, especially enjoying the company of Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is quite confusing but with GPS, I explore more, mostly with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games together and enjoy life. Sometimes, I’d go to the park to relax in nature, which brings me peace. I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken sword for fun. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast despite the tough training. Reflecting on my time in this neighborhood, I’ve had many enjoyable experiences and look forward to more great memories.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It might blend in with other towns in South Carolina, but it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly refers to itself as the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The area is mainly farmland, filled with peach trees and cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are usually set back from the road to allow the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are found. For \"fast food,\" there are three options: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to operate here but has recently closed. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, so many locals prefer traveling to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger grocery runs. Dollar General is the most frequented store, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with customers from opening to closing. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a well-known local woman and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Connected to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and after fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Currently, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more family outings and attract potential residents. Though options for entertainment like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and playgrounds are lacking, it's a pleasant town that one might easily pass by without noticing due to its small size.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, but aside from that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the residents. People generally occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, allowing us to observe the comings and goings of the neighborhood and become acquainted with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we tend to notice it. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids often ride their bikes, which is pretty typical around here. Since we work from home, my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and I are frequently at home. Consequently, the neighbors are also accustomed to seeing us around. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, with the sound of lawnmowers almost daily from March until about October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was once a wooded area, providing a lot of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a pleasant signal of fall's arrival. Recently, we've experienced mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's the same for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt everywhere. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown, and when you spot a lawn, you realize that person is likely spending a lot on maintenance. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were few and far between. Nowadays, it's still quite similar, except there are many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to look more like a city every day, but I suppose many areas are evolving in the same way. Most of the people here are very friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly older folks, which makes it a nicer area. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel since stores like Whole Foods are scarce. The most common jobs, as far as I can tell without official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because there's still a lot of undeveloped land here, with plenty of room to build. That worries me a bit because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field; I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, especially the stark beauty of the desert. The high desert's climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these animals to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun in true Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my perspective is somewhat distinct. Unlike most respondents who are likely homeowners with separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory serving as my community. I also consider the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. There are three types of housing nearby: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common building type generally has 2 floors, housing around 20 people per building. Second, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are few since they are less efficient. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms house hundreds of students, with usually two people sharing a room, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while newer students stay in dormitory housing, and older students opt for apartment-style living. It's hard to do justice to the people here with words alone, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Hence, everything needed is available within my neighborhood! Moreover, the park serves as a playground for the diverse populace, kept clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downward, with my house perched atop the steepest hill locally known as the \"work out hill\" due to the joggers who tackle it during their exercise routines. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk directly on the road, which is rough and sometimes feels risky to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the area appear worn and patched. Frequent rain and storms knock down branches and debris onto the power lines, resulting in frequent repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but locals dislike them because they block ocean views. Consequently, many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The sunset is stunning when the water seems illuminated beneath an orange sky, although clouds usually obscure the sun, leaving most days gray and damp. Moss thrives everywhere, covering roofs, cars, and railings. Once, when I left my car outside for a month, it turned green with moss, and cleaning it took three hours. Children are few despite a nearby school; the neighborhood mostly consists of older, often retired residents who prefer dogs over kids. It's typical to see dogs playing on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and they sometimes sneak into open homes. I once had to escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers locally. The area hosts various birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles, which the local crows usually chase away. There are no nearby stores, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a beach, but the rocks are fun to toss into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still experience the typical New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, particularly supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are very popular with locals, offering excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are conveniently located. Near my location, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, enhancing grocery shopping convenience. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most major and popular local businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't have many large corporate buildings, mostly offering co-op living or condominium apartments, with two-family houses being predominant. The residents are generally friendly but can be quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or revving engines that can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault in the past, although it was years ago. A recent issue has been package theft, which is common here. Despite New York City's fines for not cleaning up after pets, many here disregard the rules. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your route to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is dog waste scattered around the neighborhood. Be cautious and watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial town motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the '90s and early 2000s, a less famous and costly city fostering creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does embrace what is usually unaccepted. It doesn't mean lacking modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of America, we buy much of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps weirdness means we simply don't take it all too seriously. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, contain items someone no longer wants, often holding a perfect treasure for a passerby. They frequently have clothes and books but can contain anything. The enchanting possibility of finding something special in a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland for me, though I'm just one of many varieties of weirdness here. Some residents would never consider selecting their attire from a box on the sidewalk. These folks might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is filled with people passionate about diverse interests. Here, people chase dreams or dream of chasing them while spending too much time at bars. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. At its core, like many drug problems, it ties back to mental health, with the persistent rain and gloomy clouds contributing factors. Portland also faces homelessness, a challenge without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by the city's relatively superior social services, though still inadequate like elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we aren't weird at all.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, witnessing the sun's rise and fall every day from the north. Even when I become preoccupied with work and life and forget about them, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they demand my attention, offering solace and strength to help me carry on, day by day. When I began my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to these northern mountains near the campus. While the university boasts its own scenic beauty with its architecture, ponds, and trees, it is the mountains that truly captivate me. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés where I've spent countless hours studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown reveals a historic atmosphere with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices, giving the town a lively energy akin to its neighboring city. However, this urban vibe is fleeting, as one can retreat to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments creates a unique allure, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories, whether it's strolling through a park after an all-nighter with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like everywhere, it holds difficult memories too. The ponds, in particular, serve as places for reflection and midnight soul-searching during existential crises, which I've experienced more than once. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects, each living with purpose, I often ponder my own role in life. Walking past the pond, park, and suburban houses, I eventually reach a main street, where the sun illuminates the palm trees and paints the sky. Looking at the sunrise, I realize I'm heading north. There, as always, stand the mountains, rising above the hazy sky more prominently than any building, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—being a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, it doesn’t seem like a typical place to find homes. Not the kind most people would choose, anyway. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue beyond the hotels, mostly filled during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. In this neighborhood, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes, arranged like meticulously separated Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you encounter has been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we’ll skip over it—appearances can be misleading. However, the apartments adjacent to it, and the next two complexes, belong to a different world unknown to most locals. Opposite these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students, coffee in hand, arrive at 7 a.m., still sleepy. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while drivers shake their fists out of frustration at the traffic they cause on busier days. The road intersects another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along a path, frowning at skateboarding teens and nodding politely to girls chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Next to the park in a strip mall, there's a sushi restaurant with affordable prices, though rarely crowded—a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. It's possible to prepare your pool for summer while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens frequent with cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it’s cool. This neighborhood embodies Americana—a glimpse of history in the sleepy South, where change is rare, and time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood holds a unique charm. Most homes are single-family residences, but a few have been divided into two connected units. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it evokes a bygone era when suburban living epitomized the American dream—a dream that once embraced the nation but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, neighborhoods like mine endure, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream persists, even if we cling to it less confidently. People aren't as hopeful as before, and the little yards aren't as well-kept, but you still find a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if their world is the only one that exists. The nearly 90-year-old public school still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home looks different but shares a similar feel. A large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family—possibly the only Arab family in the area—serves the community, which is predominantly African American. The wide streets often host kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the decline in popularity of karate-themed movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, as if medication is the solution to everything, or so they say. A small movie theater shows classic films at a reduced rate, drawing older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out, minus the kids. An expressway runs through town, though the entry and exit are in the neighboring town. There was an attempt to secure an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed it would spoil the town's character. In the end, the elders convinced the city council to decline the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, where various businesses operate. These businesses include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. While some stores are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and peaceful, if not for the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks nearby that are popular for families with young children. Regarding the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a compact area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, although they often form their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can result in a lengthy drive. Driving just 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. In my city, most people don’t walk to their destinations. Despite some places being nearby, the city is large, and walking isn't a common choice. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking can be challenging almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been significant development in recent years, with large apartment buildings popping up. The city is a popular place to live, but many residents worry about more people moving in and adding more cars to the roads. There are many types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives in or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas feature houses of various sizes and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even in my immediate neighborhood, so there is a variety of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors well. It’s not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast, open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home and had never experienced so much open space. As she marveled at the abundance of cornfields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down the two-lane country road, you'll come upon a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the modest development where I live. Most houses are made of brick and stucco, each boasting at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, shimmering under the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we continue toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum with song. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he's genuine, with an intriguing past. Though he's grown older and lost some sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese scatter as our Terrier chases them. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the gentle stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them. There was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. Winters in my small town can be harsh but breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange blooms become skeletal. When it snows, a winter wonderland emerges overnight. The backyard is dotted with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In this winter wonderland, we played make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree young kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in Rural America, specifically in a small Michigan town where farmland transitions into quaint tourist spots. There aren't any large city malls, nor are there stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. To reach any destination, driving is necessary. Nevertheless, I live in one of the world's most picturesque locations, surrounded by water. My town is encircled by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, offering places to wade in. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses aren’t densely packed or identical. They are older, with some being renovated while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements visible from the street. Many houses have older aluminum siding and are painted in a variety of colors. Yards are common, often equipped with trampolines and playsets, and some residents have gardens and fences for their pets. The homes reflect Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or have done so. Children are often seen playing in the streets, and it's usual to see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, and it's easy to identify those who belong. You might see someone grilling and wave, or smile at a dog walker from a few blocks away. Lawns are well-kept, without piles of leaves from fall, and the grass is neatly trimmed. If there are plants and shrubs, they are maintained. The neighborhood may not be visually striking with impressive homes, but it feels like a good place for raising a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. Its average appearance belies its exceptional nature as it offers the safety people desire at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there’s the county sheriff’s department and jail, and the health department is nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving locals and visitors alike. We have baseball and softball fields nearby, where you can hear announcers calling scores and player names. Next to these is our small town airport, where you can hear the hum of small planes taking off and landing. You can stroll to the local ice cream shop, and if you're up for it, you can walk downtown from our neighborhood. My children can bike to the park, which is only about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to live.",
            "The area where I reside can be characterized as a standard, uniform suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of the homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice well-kept single-family homes, maintained thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are quite similar, featuring small patches of landscaped grass, decorative pebbles, and short driveways, occasionally dotted with small trees. Every house has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved concrete roads that are in excellent condition, with no potholes despite the many families living here. Most houses are single-story, though there are some two-story homes. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to an apartment complex, where each resident uses a key to access their mailbox. Two larger lockers are available for packages. This uniformity is another product of the HOA. My house is situated on the outskirts of the nearby city, making the neighborhood part rural, part suburban. This provides plenty of space for various amenities, including multiple community pools that residents can access, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails for dog walking or solo strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is large enough to run around for a good workout. Most residents are retired, creating a safe community where everyone looks out for each other, with a few middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. The city itself is surprisingly large in population but retains a small-town feel, offering most of the amenities one would expect. For instance, there is one mall, not very big but sufficient. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to any significant location, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and typical, with nice features like pools and walking trails. Although shopping isn’t right next door, a short drive provides access to any major chain store.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing persons, which caught me off guard. In this area, most apartments were priced over a thousand dollars a month, yet neither I nor my friends had ever heard that story. It might be due to the challenges we face. Some of my friends often cry themselves to sleep. Despite the high costs, we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You start to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored for a long time. Adult life carries fewer scents. You might pick up smoking, or perhaps you just get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market's aroma is always present. The smell of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after it's washed. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. You can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop if you start at one end. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrift stores, it's always quiet. Despite the traffic and crowds outside, the stores remain silent, making them a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood the area. It's regarded as a developing city, housing one of the largest e-commerce and delivery companies, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York, where everyone is focused on their own goals and doesn’t demand much from others. You can be solitary and independent, and nobody will bother you. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of care, here, people don't intrude on your life. You can maintain your privacy, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a beach. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a sense, we have more of a community of friends than just a group of strangers in an apartment. We support each other, celebrate birthdays, attend funerals, and help when needed. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail, and it's nice to see them. I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Although I live in a vast, impersonal modern development, it’s the people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town located just beyond the suburbs of a large city. My neighborhood, situated on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the area is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally amiable, often smiling and greeting me as I walk by. Although crime rates are slightly higher here than in other parts of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent crimes nearby, including shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors tragically lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, my family has only been indirectly affected by crime, such as minor thefts from our porch when we forget to secure items. The town has been significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, numerous resources are available to address this crisis, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those battling addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school boasts excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite his special needs, he has not experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he loves. We have an active PTO that organizes events throughout the year to encourage family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is marginalized due to financial constraints, and the costs for school-related expenses are quite reasonable. The City Council has made several improvements to the town's appearance, such as repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most enhancements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are concentrated and traffic is heaviest. The east side, where I live, often gets overlooked, which is a source of frustration for residents. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home may not have high market value, but it is comfortable and adequate. We've lived here for more than 16 years and can't imagine living elsewhere.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by historically significant buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building right opposite the old live theater, and a block down the hill is a trendy little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there's a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for its location in the city. The park is encircled by concrete with tall steps embedded in the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents neatly along the sidewalk and steps. It doesn't snow much, but the heavy rains in mid-winter often make it hard to stay warm. By setting up their tents close together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the historic beauty—the tall, proud buildings and the architecture scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. What I truly love is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories persist about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through to clean up the streets. The people remember, passing down these tales from generation to generation, including to newcomers like me. Despite still being considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents work hard to maintain it. They care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past and is shaped by social conditioning. Perhaps I appear just dark enough to not be seen as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions born of ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot. I know one thing: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this neighborhood just as I was about to begin eighth grade. Initially, making friends was challenging, but I eventually became close with a neighbor who lived two houses away and another person on my street. Although neither of them resides there anymore, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, featuring many two-story homes. On weekends or whenever the weather is warm, I can hear kids playing outside. The area is generally quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the people here. In this neighborhood, you're left alone unless you seek assistance. I've ordered several packages online and none have been stolen from my porch, which gives me a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is just a minute or two from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other local guys. One of my worst memories is also from there when I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just mentioning a trip to the park excites them. The park now brings back many nostalgic memories for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, offering a wide range of food options nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now prefer using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast-food places are the most popular, but these are common in most suburban areas. There are plenty of pizza places too. The local stores offer everything you might need, with multiple dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a popular chain in the Midwest. Some stores also reflect the neighborhood's diversity, like an Indian-owned store for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing other people's difficult experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I enjoy living in my neighborhood because it’s close to the college I attend. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few affordable restaurants and bars that are fun to visit. One of the bars recently changed its name and it’s a bit pricier, but the quality of service and drinks is decent. The community is mostly friendly, comprised of college students and lower-income residents, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children in the area because there's an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. Although I don't know my neighbors and don't wish to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener outside their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings around me generally look old but might have renovated interiors. A bit further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because they are poorly constructed yet have high rent, which feels like a scam due to their proximity to campus. There’s a very cheap eatery nearby that serves food on paper plates and mostly microwaves its offerings. Across from it is a gas station, which is reputed to be a poor workplace. However, the road was improved last summer thanks to city funding, adding a big sidewalk and grassy areas, making it a bit nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, though a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but the street behind, 43rd Street, isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are deteriorating, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are many trees, likely to obscure the building's appearance. Most of the crime occurs at an apartment complex on that street, but even the apartments across from me have their share of crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like living here. It’s affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university’s proximity and the two bus stops that make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes situated on a cul-de-sac. These homes are spaced in such a way that they resemble standalone houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friends, and in the evenings, we gather at random driveways to chat while the children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing contrast to our modern, technology-driven world, reminiscent of a bygone era. We are surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds overhead. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time, we heard the sirens last night, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, stayed in the living room, uneasy and barking at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the abrupt temperature drop, going from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly took pictures to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm. Then, life returned to normal, with moms and kids outside as dinner cooked. This friendly neighborhood is perfect for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accent here. Everyone has a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but despite the identical exteriors, the interiors vary, with some being quite small, which I find puzzling. I enjoy walking in the large field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a small community village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to announce his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for about a decade, I think I can share some insights. Initially, I was quite upset moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I cried because I missed my old home and loved ones. However, my parents wanted the best for my sister and me, so we moved to a neighborhood with better housing and schools, described as \"not ghetto.\" Over the years, I adjusted, made new friends, and even a few rivals at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, both living next door. They’ve been wonderful and almost feel like family, for which I’m grateful. I recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family (he remarried), which was a delightful event. I aspire to have a similar celebration one day, to provide a royal life for my future wife. At the wedding, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced all night, especially enjoying the company of Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, though I haven't seen her since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood is quite confusing but with GPS, I explore more, mostly with friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games together and enjoy life. Sometimes, I’d go to the park to relax in nature, which brings me peace. I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and sometimes bring my bokken sword for fun. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played in a while. My dad taught my best friend and me tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a blast despite the tough training. Reflecting on my time in this neighborhood, I’ve had many enjoyable experiences and look forward to more great memories.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It might blend in with other towns in South Carolina, but it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly refers to itself as the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The area is mainly farmland, filled with peach trees and cattle. Homes outside the town center are spaced widely apart, typically two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These homes are usually set back from the road to allow the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town's center, there's a solitary traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are found. For \"fast food,\" there are three options: Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to operate here but has recently closed. A tiny family-owned pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is best known for selling Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone grocery store, Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), is small and pricey, so many locals prefer traveling to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger grocery runs. Dollar General is the most frequented store, offering a wide range of everyday items and bustling with customers from opening to closing. A small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is run by a well-known local woman and employs two movers for furniture delivery. Connected to the furniture store is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; they are small but well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and after fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Currently, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide more family outings and attract potential residents. Though options for entertainment like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and playgrounds are lacking, it's a pleasant town that one might easily pass by without noticing due to its small size.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, but aside from that, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so I'm familiar with most of the residents. People generally occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, allowing us to observe the comings and goings of the neighborhood and become acquainted with the local vehicles. When an unfamiliar car appears, we tend to notice it. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs, and kids often ride their bikes, which is pretty typical around here. Since we work from home, my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and I are frequently at home. Consequently, the neighbors are also accustomed to seeing us around. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems there's always someone mowing their lawn around here, with the sound of lawnmowers almost daily from March until about October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees, as it was once a wooded area, providing a lot of shade but also lots of leaves in the fall. This means we rake and burn the leaves annually, and I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, a pleasant signal of fall's arrival. Recently, we've experienced mild winters, making it feel like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is uncommon. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and when the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are generally quiet here. During Thanksgiving, some families host out-of-town visitors, leading to more parked cars, and it's the same for other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt everywhere. Unless you've lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant sight of brown, and when you spot a lawn, you realize that person is likely spending a lot on maintenance. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were few and far between. Nowadays, it's still quite similar, except there are many new developments. Honestly, this place is starting to look more like a city every day, but I suppose many areas are evolving in the same way. Most of the people here are very friendly, but like any city, there are both good and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly older folks, which makes it a nicer area. The stores around here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you have to travel since stores like Whole Foods are scarce. The most common jobs, as far as I can tell without official statistics, are in construction. This is likely because there's still a lot of undeveloped land here, with plenty of room to build. That worries me a bit because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and don't want to return to that lifestyle. Speaking of construction, my full-time job is in that field; I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about living here are the various animals. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, especially the stark beauty of the desert. The high desert's climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to diverse wildlife. Residents should take the time to learn about these animals to coexist peacefully. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, we do have some. Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert, offering a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with the annual San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a mix of activities and fun in true Victorville style. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum features geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my perspective is somewhat distinct. Unlike most respondents who are likely homeowners with separate lives, my situation is slightly different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory serving as my community. I also consider the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's important to clarify the types of housing available here. There are three types of housing nearby: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. First, apartments typically accommodate 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. The most common building type generally has 2 floors, housing around 20 people per building. Second, the actual houses are available for rent to those affiliated with the school, usually featuring 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are few since they are less efficient. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms house hundreds of students, with usually two people sharing a room, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is reflected in my neighborhood's makeup. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while newer students stay in dormitory housing, and older students opt for apartment-style living. It's hard to do justice to the people here with words alone, so let's move on to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery stores. Hence, everything needed is available within my neighborhood! Moreover, the park serves as a playground for the diverse populace, kept clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are scarce. The terrain slopes downward, with my house perched atop the steepest hill locally known as the \"work out hill\" due to the joggers who tackle it during their exercise routines. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, people walk directly on the road, which is rough and sometimes feels risky to drive on. The telephone and electric wires around the area appear worn and patched. Frequent rain and storms knock down branches and debris onto the power lines, resulting in frequent repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but locals dislike them because they block ocean views. Consequently, many houses are built high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted second stories to capture the bay view. The sunset is stunning when the water seems illuminated beneath an orange sky, although clouds usually obscure the sun, leaving most days gray and damp. Moss thrives everywhere, covering roofs, cars, and railings. Once, when I left my car outside for a month, it turned green with moss, and cleaning it took three hours. Children are few despite a nearby school; the neighborhood mostly consists of older, often retired residents who prefer dogs over kids. It's typical to see dogs playing on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and they sometimes sneak into open homes. I once had to escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits, some quite large, roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they dig up plants and lawns. My cats enjoy hunting them, reducing their numbers locally. The area hosts various birds, from small sparrows and hummingbirds to occasional hawks or eagles, which the local crows usually chase away. There are no nearby stores, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a beach, but the rocks are fun to toss into the bay. The bay itself is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore even on misty days.",
            "If you're planning a trip to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it! Public transportation is easily accessible and widely used in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite urban, so you'll still experience the typical New York City vibe. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian stores throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll find an Asian-owned store on almost every block, particularly supermarkets and laundromats. These businesses are very popular with locals, offering excellent quality food at lower prices, and they are conveniently located. Near my location, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk from each other, enhancing grocery shopping convenience. However, Bensonhurst isn't solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children living here. Most major and popular local businesses are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there's a newly renovated park nearby, featuring about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally diverse, with people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't have many large corporate buildings, mostly offering co-op living or condominium apartments, with two-family houses being predominant. The residents are generally friendly but can be quite noisy. Daily, you'll hear cars blasting music or revving engines that can wake you up in the morning. If you visit at night, stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but people can be unpredictable, and you might encounter troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. I've personally experienced bullying through physical assault in the past, although it was years ago. A recent issue has been package theft, which is common here. Despite New York City's fines for not cleaning up after pets, many here disregard the rules. Each morning, you'll likely encounter dog waste on your route to the train station or supermarket. My biggest annoyance is dog waste scattered around the neighborhood. Be cautious and watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To truly grasp Portland, Oregon, you must first understand its definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial town motto, displayed on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it's a nostalgic reminder of the Portland from the '90s and early 2000s, a less famous and costly city fostering creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does embrace what is usually unaccepted. It doesn't mean lacking modern amenities or struggles. Like the rest of America, we buy much of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, yet Portland has its share of normalcy. You'll find yoga, hipsters, and business professionals here. Perhaps weirdness means we simply don't take it all too seriously. My neighborhood, like many in Portland, features colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and vegetables, and free boxes during the summer. Free boxes, which are often cardboard but can be plastic, contain items someone no longer wants, often holding a perfect treasure for a passerby. They frequently have clothes and books but can contain anything. The enchanting possibility of finding something special in a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland for me, though I'm just one of many varieties of weirdness here. Some residents would never consider selecting their attire from a box on the sidewalk. These folks might prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer matches. Portland is filled with people passionate about diverse interests. Here, people chase dreams or dream of chasing them while spending too much time at bars. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. At its core, like many drug problems, it ties back to mental health, with the persistent rain and gloomy clouds contributing factors. Portland also faces homelessness, a challenge without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by the city's relatively superior social services, though still inadequate like elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we aren't weird at all.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence, witnessing the sun's rise and fall every day from the north. Even when I become preoccupied with work and life and forget about them, they remain steadfast, unaffected by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they demand my attention, offering solace and strength to help me carry on, day by day. When I began my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to these northern mountains near the campus. While the university boasts its own scenic beauty with its architecture, ponds, and trees, it is the mountains that truly captivate me. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés where I've spent countless hours studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown reveals a historic atmosphere with faded brick buildings housing restaurants and offices, giving the town a lively energy akin to its neighboring city. However, this urban vibe is fleeting, as one can retreat to the peacefulness of the small town by passing the library. This contrast of environments creates a unique allure, inviting exploration and the creation of cherished memories, whether it's strolling through a park after an all-nighter with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a movie at the theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like everywhere, it holds difficult memories too. The ponds, in particular, serve as places for reflection and midnight soul-searching during existential crises, which I've experienced more than once. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects, each living with purpose, I often ponder my own role in life. Walking past the pond, park, and suburban houses, I eventually reach a main street, where the sun illuminates the palm trees and paints the sky. Looking at the sunrise, I realize I'm heading north. There, as always, stand the mountains, rising above the hazy sky more prominently than any building, silently inspiring my perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—being a residential area tucked behind a shopping strip, it doesn’t seem like a typical place to find homes. Not the kind most people would choose, anyway. But if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and continue beyond the hotels, mostly filled during summer family reunions, you'll discover a lively community. In this neighborhood, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes, arranged like meticulously separated Russian nesting dolls. The first complex you encounter has been in the news for some unsavory incidents, so we’ll skip over it—appearances can be misleading. However, the apartments adjacent to it, and the next two complexes, belong to a different world unknown to most locals. Opposite these complexes lies a satellite campus of a community college, a quiet set of buildings where students, coffee in hand, arrive at 7 a.m., still sleepy. The iron gates creak open to let them in, while drivers shake their fists out of frustration at the traffic they cause on busier days. The road intersects another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center has cheerful porch furniture and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play energetically in the park, while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along a path, frowning at skateboarding teens and nodding politely to girls chatting about boys and YouTube stars near the playground. Next to the park in a strip mall, there's a sushi restaurant with affordable prices, though rarely crowded—a swimming supply store, and a nail salon in between. It's possible to prepare your pool for summer while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There’s also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where teens frequent with cups of yogurt, doing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it’s cool. This neighborhood embodies Americana—a glimpse of history in the sleepy South, where change is rare, and time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood holds a unique charm. Most homes are single-family residences, but a few have been divided into two connected units. My house features a small front yard and a driveway on the left. Like many others, it evokes a bygone era when suburban living epitomized the American dream—a dream that once embraced the nation but now seems to be slipping away. Yet, neighborhoods like mine endure, reminding both residents and visitors that the dream persists, even if we cling to it less confidently. People aren't as hopeful as before, and the little yards aren't as well-kept, but you still find a car or two in every driveway, and children play as if their world is the only one that exists. The nearly 90-year-old public school still stands, inspiring today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each home looks different but shares a similar feel. A large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a prominent Yemeni family—possibly the only Arab family in the area—serves the community, which is predominantly African American. The wide streets often host kids playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Many residents have lived here for generations and can recount times when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but after the decline in popularity of karate-themed movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, as if medication is the solution to everything, or so they say. A small movie theater shows classic films at a reduced rate, drawing older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out, minus the kids. An expressway runs through town, though the entry and exit are in the neighboring town. There was an attempt to secure an exit for our town, supported by the youth but opposed by the elders, who believed it would spoil the town's character. In the end, the elders convinced the city council to decline the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and we're debating a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a large city means my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly at random among commercial zones, where various businesses operate. These businesses include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is always a new restaurant to try or a shop to visit. While some stores are big, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. These boutiques are not only found in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and peaceful, if not for the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks nearby that are popular for families with young children. Regarding the residents, my neighborhood is quite diverse. In a compact area, we have a notable LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are people of various races and backgrounds, although they often form their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and more, just a few miles away. However, even a few miles can result in a lengthy drive. Driving just 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. In my city, most people don’t walk to their destinations. Despite some places being nearby, the city is large, and walking isn't a common choice. Consequently, we experience some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking can be challenging almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been significant development in recent years, with large apartment buildings popping up. The city is a popular place to live, but many residents worry about more people moving in and adding more cars to the roads. There are many types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives in or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas feature houses of various sizes and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even in my immediate neighborhood, so there is a variety of housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood consists of people of different ages, and honestly, I don’t know most of my neighbors well. It’s not a close-knit community these days, although I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, anticipating her surprise at the vast, open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home and had never experienced so much open space. As she marveled at the abundance of cornfields, I shared what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Traveling down the two-lane country road, you'll come upon a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it lies the modest development where I live. Most houses are made of brick and stucco, each boasting at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars, shimmering under the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we continue toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside, greeting us with a warm smile. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum with song. Everyone in the neighborhood enjoys his presence; he's genuine, with an intriguing past. Though he's grown older and lost some sharpness, he was once a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Eventually, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese scatter as our Terrier chases them. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, where you can hear bullfrogs, the gentle stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent much of my childhood, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them. There was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. Winters in my small town can be harsh but breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a lush green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant pink, purple, and orange blooms become skeletal. When it snows, a winter wonderland emerges overnight. The backyard is dotted with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often quarreled as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We'd construct massive igloo-like forts to store our arsenal, usually with branches. In this winter wonderland, we played make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were just carefree young kids."
