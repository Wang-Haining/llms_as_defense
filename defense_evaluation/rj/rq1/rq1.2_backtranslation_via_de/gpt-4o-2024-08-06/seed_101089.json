            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Wherever you need to go, you have to drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water. On one side is the stunning Lake Michigan, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes into. My neighborhood reflects the concept of a small town. Houses aren't packed together. They aren't cookie-cutter homes. They are older houses, some of which have been updated and remodeled, while others remain as they were. Most homes have basements, full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses of every color you can imagine in the blocks around my home. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America. Hardworking people striving to make a living and either raising families or having raised families. On any given day, you'll see children running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and you can recognize who belongs and who doesn’t. You'll see someone grilling outside and waving, or even someone walking their dog a few blocks away who smiles pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from the fall. Green grass is kept mowed and orderly. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed. It isn’t a neighborhood that stuns you with its beauty, but one that makes you think it would be a good place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it looks average, it is exceptional because it represents what people want in the world: a safe place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear announcers keeping score and calling players' names. Our small town airport is next to it. You can be playing outside or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you’re really into it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only about 8 blocks away. It is truly a great place to live.",
            "The general area where I live can be described as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you see only well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are all quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Occasionally, you'll also see small trees. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or similar issues. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two-story ones as well. We don't have the typical mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments with a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. My house is located on the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as partly rural, partly suburban. As a result, we have a lot of land for various things. There are multiple community pools that anyone living here can access. They are well-maintained and gated. There are also various walking trails where you can walk your dog or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't need to visit a park to get your exercise. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we also have a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large—at least in terms of population—but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities you would expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it serves its purpose. For me, it takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach anywhere significant, but once I do, I'm greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and have minimal staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain you like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing people. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment in the area was over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard anything about that story, nor had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggles. I know some friends who cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but over the years, we've learned to be frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. As an adult, you smell a lot less. Maybe you start smoking, or maybe you're just used to the state of things. But the flea market always makes itself known. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself into the leather and stays even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is dense, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you won't hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Each year, there are more of them. Cars and people flood in. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it still shows growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone and everything are focused on their own goals, and not much is asked of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a bit of concern shows you care. Here, you don't really pry into anyone's life. You can maintain your shell as long as you like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we are less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them, and they to me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged part. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of the town, they are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for occasionally having an item disappear from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. Overall, the town I live in has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" impacting many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying due to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located, and most traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater, and a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you'll see people lined up outside waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large considering the part of town it's in. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it does rain, and the heavy downpours in mid-winter often make it hard to keep warm. Setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than out in the wild, helps keep them warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historic features—the tall, proud buildings, the architecture scattered across the hills that roll down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious area on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories are still told about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are passed from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about those days. The residents work hard, even though it's still considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city, on their block. It's said that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Maybe I'm just dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who is painfully aware of the issues that continually affect our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I wander, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often and rarely with ill intent offered me a jacket rather than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few minutes longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest, dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, it was difficult for me to make friends, but eventually, I became close to someone who lived two houses down and another person on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who lived here when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend, or whenever it's warm, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had any issues with the people here. You're left alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online and none have been taken from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with others from the neighborhood. I also had one of my worst experiences there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park now makes me nostalgic for several reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. The most popular places are fast food spots, which are common in any suburban area. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you might need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse as well; there is an Indian-owned store if you ever want to make homemade Indian food or buy ready-made Indian dishes. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading on social media and watching the news about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that reason, I really enjoy living there. There are mainly apartment buildings, but also some restaurants and bars that are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but the quality of service or drinks there isn't really bad. Most of the people are nice. They are either students or have a low income, since the apartments aren't very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, but I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of weed, so the management of my building placed an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very amusing. It's almost insulting. The buildings around me usually look quite old, but might have renovated interiors. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't like them because I know the construction wasn't particularly good. They're cheaply built, but the rent is high, which I think is a scam, but since they're near the campus, the building management can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and mostly microwaves their dishes. Across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was redone last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area is now a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut some of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are many more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and that one isn't as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that's probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can't blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced and arranged to look like individual houses. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, though not all, is friends with each other. Some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's very refreshing in this modern, overly mechanical/computer-filled world. It's a bit like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we're experiencing tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we actually heard tornado sirens, so we had to seek shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking, uneasy about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the temperature change. We went from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted on hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun appeared and it started to rain. A double rainbow emerged. I ran into the house, grabbed my camera, and quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before some people finally returned from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was back to normal, with moms and children outside as dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as does everyone. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all the apartments are the same inside. Some are actually quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I love to walk along the largest field behind where I live and wander down to the pond that isn't meant for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small community village of its own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he's there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Since I've been here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. Initially, I was quite sad when I moved into my neighborhood. I relocated from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we moved to a better place with improved housing and a better high school. Everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it, made some new friends, and also some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, who were right next to us. They were pleasant people I can almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I remember when my mom, dad, sister, and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried). It was really fun and enjoyable, to say the least, and it's something I look forward to someday as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the little white band on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can spend more time exploring it. I've only gone so far when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calm and peace these days. I also bring some sticks I bought from the home depot and just practice my balance, and I take my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time. It's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try again. My dad raised me and my best friend on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there have been many times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stood out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It may not stand out from others in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, a fact the town proudly displays on its welcome sign. The area is mainly composed of farmland, dominated by peach orchards or cattle pastures. Houses outside the main town area are spaced widely apart; most are two-story buildings with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Often, these homes are set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores in the town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed not long ago. There's a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, humorously best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There's also a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Although it's the only grocery store in town, many people only stop by for one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. The most popular store in town is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday items and is often busy from opening to closing! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a friendly woman well-known in the community. The store has been a part of Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who deliver purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store is a small pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer various services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located away from the town's center; they are small but well-equipped to assist Johnston's residents. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After completing fifth grade, students must attend middle and high school in the next town. Technically, there are no parks in the town, but they are currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outings and to attract more visitors and potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a street that connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. People mainly keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars people drive around here. If we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and do the typical things you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say everyone else is used to our comings and goings too. We go outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn around here, and you can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees since it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but also lots of leaves in the fall. That means raking and burning leaves every year. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves too, so it's a nice sign that fall has arrived. Recently, we haven't had much of a winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when the garage doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite calm around here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families visit with out-of-town guests, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through-street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't fully understand the constant sight of brown, and when you see a lawn, it’s clear that the homeowner is spending a lot on its maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread far apart. Now it's mostly the same, but with many new additions. Honestly, this place looks more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing in the same way. Most of the time, people are very friendly, but just like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale shopping, you have to travel; I hardly ever see any Whole Foods or similar stores. The most common jobs in my city, not based on any official demographics, seem to be in construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, with lots of open space to build on. That kind of worries me, as I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not eager to go back. Speaking of construction, this is the field my full-time job is in; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they’re all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It offers a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to complete your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, I believe my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are likely homeowners with their own lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some similarities with more conventional neighborhood ideas. Just like any traditional neighborhood, the area I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before exploring the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people in a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so on average, there are around 20 people living in each building. Second, there are the actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. Typically, these are 2-4 bedroom setups where alumni usually live. However, there are only a few of these types of houses scattered throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorms that house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff live in the houses located in the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing and older students reside in apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be justly described only in words, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is truly its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options found in any other neighborhood and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, everything needed can be found within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people, kept clean and crime-free by all members of my neighborhood!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks in the area where I live. Everything seems to slope downward, and my house is right at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has potholes in some places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and power lines strung around the block look worn. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often knock down the power lines, and the constant repairs give them a patched and checkerboard appearance. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here dislike the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories rising one after the other to capture the view of the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. However, it is mostly cloudy, so you often see most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked in my driveway for a month, and when I went to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't many children around where I live, though there is a school just a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting on people's lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you risk them sneaking into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into people's lawns. However, my cats love them and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can clearly see the opposite shoreline, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transport is very accessible and one of the most popular ways to travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see numerous Asian stores everywhere. Over the last two decades, Bensonhurst has seen an influx of Asian residents. Because of this, you will see at least one Asian-owned store on every block as you walk. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents because the quality of food in the supermarkets is excellent, the prices are much cheaper, and it is very convenient. Right nearby, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other. This only adds to the convenience of grocery shopping. I'm not saying Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the area are Asian-owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy in the summer. Since we are in New York City, the parks are, of course, very diverse. You'll see all sorts of people here able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you'd find are for co-op living or condominium apartments. However, most of the living spaces here are two-family houses. Most people are quite nice, but very noisy. Every day, you would hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house or constantly revving their engines, which will wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, you should be cautious. This neighborhood is quite safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might run into people who want to cause trouble for no reason, bullies, and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package theft. Although it's a common issue, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station or the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, found on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts legality in at least half of these roles, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was lesser-known and less pricey, nurturing creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is an enticing call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but now as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the continuous construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't always mean accepting, but it does mean embracing things that are typically not accepted. Weird doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or contemporary struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways of being weird, of being not normal, yet Portland also has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we simply take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes with items someone is discarding, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often contain something magical, a treasure perfectly suited for someone passing by, surprisingly often. Free boxes usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, that's what Portland is to me, but I am just one type of weird among many. Some people I live among would never dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers games (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all kinds of things. Portland is full of people who pursue their dreams, or dream of pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. Drug issues are often rooted in mental health problems, and the constant rain for much of the year, along with the dreary clouds, seems to contribute. Portland also faces a homelessness issue, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than most parts of the country, but our services are inadequate, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population fluctuates between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are ever-present. In the north, they observe the sun's journey at every dawn and dusk. No matter how much I forget them or how consumed I am by work and life to notice, they remain steadfast, unchallenged, and indifferent to life's troubles. On days when I am most stressed and tense, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of the campus were what initially captivated me. The university indeed has its fair share of breathtaking sights in its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold part of my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own way. Countless cafés have been home to many hours of caffeine-driven studying. One can walk or take a bus a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks lining the restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and energy as its neighboring urban city. However, this doesn't last for many blocks, as one can once again escape to the serene small town by passing the library. This juxtaposition of atmospheres in such close proximity gives this city a wondrous vibe, as if it beckons to be explored. With this, it's easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a particular part of town. Whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places inevitably are in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as for crying sessions at two in the morning during an existential crisis. The latter is something I have more experience with. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each contributing or playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this enigma called life. So, I walked past the pond, past the park and the little houses that epitomize suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays over the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not typically where you'd expect to find places to live. At least, not places most would choose to live in. But if you venture past the old, abandoned Whole Foods and behind the hotels, which are only occupied annually except for a few summer stints for family reunions, you will discover a bustling community. On these streets, within these communities, are a handful of apartment complexes—carefully lined up next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, meticulously taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first apartments you encounter have been in the news for some rather unsavory incidents, so let's not dwell on those—appearances can be deceiving, after all. However, the apartments next to that complex, and the two beside them, belong to a completely different world that almost no one in the area knows about. Across from these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet, sleepy cluster of buildings standing sentinel by the road, where students trickle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan about the traffic when attendance is higher. The road leads into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones under unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Across the street at the park, children run back and forth on the grass, doing cartwheels and somersaults over the prickly green blades while bees lazily buzz around the flower patches by the road. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park with inexpensive food that never seems too busy—a swimming supply store right beside it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could prepare your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—all at once, the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place there, one of those DIY types, and you often see teens in the park holding cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while performing tricks on their skateboards and vaping because they believe it's the coolest thing. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where almost nothing changes, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is quite interesting. While most of the houses are single-family, a few have been divided into two units, yet remain attached, if that makes sense. My home features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban life was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this nation, but now it seems to be slipping away. However, my neighborhood and many others still persist, still calling out to us and visitors that the dream is alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. The people don't feel as hopeful as they once did, the upkeep of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if their surroundings were their entire world. The public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, igniting a future in today's young people, while stirring nostalgia among older residents. The churches are few and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. All the homes look different, yet they feel the same. A large supermarket called Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, who might be the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the residents are African American. The streets are broad, and kids usually play football, pausing only to let cars through. Many in my neighborhood have been here for generations and can share stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest in being the Karate Kid, so now it's a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discount, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders, who find it a small cost for a night out, without the kids of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, but the elders disagreed. They believed that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, convincing the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Since I live in a big city, my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered, seemingly at random, among commercial zones where various businesses operate. Some of these businesses include offices, while others are shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new places to eat or shop. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. They are not only located in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene if not surrounded by so many attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I've noticed that people often visit these parks with their young children. Regarding the people, there is indeed quite a bit of diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a mix of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Extending a bit further outside my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they sometimes form their own small communities within the city. We have places known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, just a few miles can mean a very long drive. Covering only 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere. While certain points of interest are inevitably close, the city is huge, and people generally do not prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be hard to find parking spots almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the idea of even more people moving in and more vehicles on the roads. However, there are many different types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in a large apartment building. Residential areas consist of houses of different sizes, as well as smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even within my immediate neighborhood, so there is no lack of diversity regarding housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of various ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with most of my neighbors. It is not really a close-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all close to my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she would be shocked by the openness of the landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her house—she had never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the omnipresent cornfields, I described to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you reach a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development where I live. The houses are mainly made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, perennial flowers abound, along with Midwest trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. Continuing along the road to my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly demeanor. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his singing audible over the mower's hum. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has aged and lost some of his sharpness over time. In his past, he was a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you reach my home. In the side yard, geese are plentiful, chased by our terrier. Out back, there's a small stream feeding into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (which mostly meant chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be brutally harsh, yet there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often fought as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts to store our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played make-believe in a time when nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Wherever you need to go, you have to drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water. On one side is the stunning Lake Michigan, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes into. My neighborhood reflects the concept of a small town. Houses aren't packed together. They aren't cookie-cutter homes. They are older houses, some of which have been updated and remodeled, while others remain as they were. Most homes have basements, full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses of every color you can imagine in the blocks around my home. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America. Hardworking people striving to make a living and either raising families or having raised families. On any given day, you'll see children running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and you can recognize who belongs and who doesn’t. You'll see someone grilling outside and waving, or even someone walking their dog a few blocks away who smiles pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from the fall. Green grass is kept mowed and orderly. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed. It isn’t a neighborhood that stuns you with its beauty, but one that makes you think it would be a good place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it looks average, it is exceptional because it represents what people want in the world: a safe place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear announcers keeping score and calling players' names. Our small town airport is next to it. You can be playing outside or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you’re really into it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only about 8 blocks away. It is truly a great place to live.",
            "The general area where I live can be described as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you see only well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are all quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Occasionally, you'll also see small trees. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or similar issues. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two-story ones as well. We don't have the typical mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments with a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. My house is located on the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as partly rural, partly suburban. As a result, we have a lot of land for various things. There are multiple community pools that anyone living here can access. They are well-maintained and gated. There are also various walking trails where you can walk your dog or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't need to visit a park to get your exercise. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we also have a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large—at least in terms of population—but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities you would expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it serves its purpose. For me, it takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach anywhere significant, but once I do, I'm greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and have minimal staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain you like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing people. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment in the area was over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard anything about that story, nor had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggles. I know some friends who cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but over the years, we've learned to be frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. As an adult, you smell a lot less. Maybe you start smoking, or maybe you're just used to the state of things. But the flea market always makes itself known. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself into the leather and stays even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is dense, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you won't hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Each year, there are more of them. Cars and people flood in. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it still shows growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone and everything are focused on their own goals, and not much is asked of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a bit of concern shows you care. Here, you don't really pry into anyone's life. You can maintain your shell as long as you like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we are less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them, and they to me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged part. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of the town, they are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for occasionally having an item disappear from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. Overall, the town I live in has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" impacting many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying due to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located, and most traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater, and a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you'll see people lined up outside waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large considering the part of town it's in. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it does rain, and the heavy downpours in mid-winter often make it hard to keep warm. Setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than out in the wild, helps keep them warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historic features—the tall, proud buildings, the architecture scattered across the hills that roll down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious area on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories are still told about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are passed from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about those days. The residents work hard, even though it's still considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city, on their block. It's said that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Maybe I'm just dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who is painfully aware of the issues that continually affect our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I wander, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often and rarely with ill intent offered me a jacket rather than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few minutes longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest, dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, it was difficult for me to make friends, but eventually, I became close to someone who lived two houses down and another person on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who lived here when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend, or whenever it's warm, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had any issues with the people here. You're left alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online and none have been taken from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with others from the neighborhood. I also had one of my worst experiences there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park now makes me nostalgic for several reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. The most popular places are fast food spots, which are common in any suburban area. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you might need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse as well; there is an Indian-owned store if you ever want to make homemade Indian food or buy ready-made Indian dishes. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading on social media and watching the news about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that reason, I really enjoy living there. There are mainly apartment buildings, but also some restaurants and bars that are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but the quality of service or drinks there isn't really bad. Most of the people are nice. They are either students or have a low income, since the apartments aren't very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, but I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of weed, so the management of my building placed an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very amusing. It's almost insulting. The buildings around me usually look quite old, but might have renovated interiors. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't like them because I know the construction wasn't particularly good. They're cheaply built, but the rent is high, which I think is a scam, but since they're near the campus, the building management can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and mostly microwaves their dishes. Across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was redone last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area is now a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut some of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are many more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and that one isn't as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that's probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can't blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced and arranged to look like individual houses. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, though not all, is friends with each other. Some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's very refreshing in this modern, overly mechanical/computer-filled world. It's a bit like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we're experiencing tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we actually heard tornado sirens, so we had to seek shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking, uneasy about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the temperature change. We went from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted on hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun appeared and it started to rain. A double rainbow emerged. I ran into the house, grabbed my camera, and quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before some people finally returned from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was back to normal, with moms and children outside as dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as does everyone. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all the apartments are the same inside. Some are actually quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I love to walk along the largest field behind where I live and wander down to the pond that isn't meant for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small community village of its own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he's there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Since I've been here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. Initially, I was quite sad when I moved into my neighborhood. I relocated from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we moved to a better place with improved housing and a better high school. Everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it, made some new friends, and also some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, who were right next to us. They were pleasant people I can almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I remember when my mom, dad, sister, and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried). It was really fun and enjoyable, to say the least, and it's something I look forward to someday as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the little white band on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can spend more time exploring it. I've only gone so far when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calm and peace these days. I also bring some sticks I bought from the home depot and just practice my balance, and I take my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time. It's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try again. My dad raised me and my best friend on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there have been many times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stood out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It may not stand out from others in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, a fact the town proudly displays on its welcome sign. The area is mainly composed of farmland, dominated by peach orchards or cattle pastures. Houses outside the main town area are spaced widely apart; most are two-story buildings with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Often, these homes are set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores in the town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed not long ago. There's a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, humorously best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There's also a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Although it's the only grocery store in town, many people only stop by for one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. The most popular store in town is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday items and is often busy from opening to closing! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a friendly woman well-known in the community. The store has been a part of Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who deliver purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store is a small pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer various services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located away from the town's center; they are small but well-equipped to assist Johnston's residents. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After completing fifth grade, students must attend middle and high school in the next town. Technically, there are no parks in the town, but they are currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outings and to attract more visitors and potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a street that connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. People mainly keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars people drive around here. If we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and do the typical things you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say everyone else is used to our comings and goings too. We go outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn around here, and you can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees since it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but also lots of leaves in the fall. That means raking and burning leaves every year. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves too, so it's a nice sign that fall has arrived. Recently, we haven't had much of a winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when the garage doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite calm around here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families visit with out-of-town guests, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through-street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't fully understand the constant sight of brown, and when you see a lawn, it’s clear that the homeowner is spending a lot on its maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread far apart. Now it's mostly the same, but with many new additions. Honestly, this place looks more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing in the same way. Most of the time, people are very friendly, but just like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale shopping, you have to travel; I hardly ever see any Whole Foods or similar stores. The most common jobs in my city, not based on any official demographics, seem to be in construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, with lots of open space to build on. That kind of worries me, as I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not eager to go back. Speaking of construction, this is the field my full-time job is in; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they’re all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It offers a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to complete your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, I believe my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are likely homeowners with their own lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some similarities with more conventional neighborhood ideas. Just like any traditional neighborhood, the area I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before exploring the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people in a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so on average, there are around 20 people living in each building. Second, there are the actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. Typically, these are 2-4 bedroom setups where alumni usually live. However, there are only a few of these types of houses scattered throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorms that house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff live in the houses located in the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing and older students reside in apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be justly described only in words, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is truly its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options found in any other neighborhood and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, everything needed can be found within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people, kept clean and crime-free by all members of my neighborhood!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks in the area where I live. Everything seems to slope downward, and my house is right at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has potholes in some places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and power lines strung around the block look worn. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often knock down the power lines, and the constant repairs give them a patched and checkerboard appearance. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here dislike the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories rising one after the other to capture the view of the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. However, it is mostly cloudy, so you often see most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked in my driveway for a month, and when I went to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't many children around where I live, though there is a school just a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting on people's lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you risk them sneaking into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into people's lawns. However, my cats love them and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can clearly see the opposite shoreline, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transport is very accessible and one of the most popular ways to travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see numerous Asian stores everywhere. Over the last two decades, Bensonhurst has seen an influx of Asian residents. Because of this, you will see at least one Asian-owned store on every block as you walk. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents because the quality of food in the supermarkets is excellent, the prices are much cheaper, and it is very convenient. Right nearby, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other. This only adds to the convenience of grocery shopping. I'm not saying Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the area are Asian-owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy in the summer. Since we are in New York City, the parks are, of course, very diverse. You'll see all sorts of people here able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you'd find are for co-op living or condominium apartments. However, most of the living spaces here are two-family houses. Most people are quite nice, but very noisy. Every day, you would hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house or constantly revving their engines, which will wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, you should be cautious. This neighborhood is quite safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might run into people who want to cause trouble for no reason, bullies, and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package theft. Although it's a common issue, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station or the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, found on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts legality in at least half of these roles, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was lesser-known and less pricey, nurturing creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is an enticing call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but now as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the continuous construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't always mean accepting, but it does mean embracing things that are typically not accepted. Weird doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or contemporary struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways of being weird, of being not normal, yet Portland also has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we simply take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes with items someone is discarding, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often contain something magical, a treasure perfectly suited for someone passing by, surprisingly often. Free boxes usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, that's what Portland is to me, but I am just one type of weird among many. Some people I live among would never dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers games (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all kinds of things. Portland is full of people who pursue their dreams, or dream of pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. Drug issues are often rooted in mental health problems, and the constant rain for much of the year, along with the dreary clouds, seems to contribute. Portland also faces a homelessness issue, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than most parts of the country, but our services are inadequate, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population fluctuates between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are ever-present. In the north, they observe the sun's journey at every dawn and dusk. No matter how much I forget them or how consumed I am by work and life to notice, they remain steadfast, unchallenged, and indifferent to life's troubles. On days when I am most stressed and tense, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of the campus were what initially captivated me. The university indeed has its fair share of breathtaking sights in its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold part of my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own way. Countless cafés have been home to many hours of caffeine-driven studying. One can walk or take a bus a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks lining the restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and energy as its neighboring urban city. However, this doesn't last for many blocks, as one can once again escape to the serene small town by passing the library. This juxtaposition of atmospheres in such close proximity gives this city a wondrous vibe, as if it beckons to be explored. With this, it's easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a particular part of town. Whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places inevitably are in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as for crying sessions at two in the morning during an existential crisis. The latter is something I have more experience with. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each contributing or playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this enigma called life. So, I walked past the pond, past the park and the little houses that epitomize suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays over the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not typically where you'd expect to find places to live. At least, not places most would choose to live in. But if you venture past the old, abandoned Whole Foods and behind the hotels, which are only occupied annually except for a few summer stints for family reunions, you will discover a bustling community. On these streets, within these communities, are a handful of apartment complexes—carefully lined up next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, meticulously taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first apartments you encounter have been in the news for some rather unsavory incidents, so let's not dwell on those—appearances can be deceiving, after all. However, the apartments next to that complex, and the two beside them, belong to a completely different world that almost no one in the area knows about. Across from these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet, sleepy cluster of buildings standing sentinel by the road, where students trickle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan about the traffic when attendance is higher. The road leads into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones under unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Across the street at the park, children run back and forth on the grass, doing cartwheels and somersaults over the prickly green blades while bees lazily buzz around the flower patches by the road. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park with inexpensive food that never seems too busy—a swimming supply store right beside it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could prepare your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—all at once, the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place there, one of those DIY types, and you often see teens in the park holding cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while performing tricks on their skateboards and vaping because they believe it's the coolest thing. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where almost nothing changes, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is quite interesting. While most of the houses are single-family, a few have been divided into two units, yet remain attached, if that makes sense. My home features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban life was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this nation, but now it seems to be slipping away. However, my neighborhood and many others still persist, still calling out to us and visitors that the dream is alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. The people don't feel as hopeful as they once did, the upkeep of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if their surroundings were their entire world. The public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, igniting a future in today's young people, while stirring nostalgia among older residents. The churches are few and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. All the homes look different, yet they feel the same. A large supermarket called Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, who might be the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the residents are African American. The streets are broad, and kids usually play football, pausing only to let cars through. Many in my neighborhood have been here for generations and can share stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest in being the Karate Kid, so now it's a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discount, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders, who find it a small cost for a night out, without the kids of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, but the elders disagreed. They believed that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, convincing the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Since I live in a big city, my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered, seemingly at random, among commercial zones where various businesses operate. Some of these businesses include offices, while others are shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new places to eat or shop. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. They are not only located in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene if not surrounded by so many attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I've noticed that people often visit these parks with their young children. Regarding the people, there is indeed quite a bit of diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a mix of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Extending a bit further outside my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they sometimes form their own small communities within the city. We have places known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, just a few miles can mean a very long drive. Covering only 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere. While certain points of interest are inevitably close, the city is huge, and people generally do not prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be hard to find parking spots almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the idea of even more people moving in and more vehicles on the roads. However, there are many different types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in a large apartment building. Residential areas consist of houses of different sizes, as well as smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even within my immediate neighborhood, so there is no lack of diversity regarding housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of various ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with most of my neighbors. It is not really a close-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all close to my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she would be shocked by the openness of the landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her house—she had never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the omnipresent cornfields, I described to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you reach a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development where I live. The houses are mainly made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, perennial flowers abound, along with Midwest trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. Continuing along the road to my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly demeanor. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his singing audible over the mower's hum. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has aged and lost some of his sharpness over time. In his past, he was a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you reach my home. In the side yard, geese are plentiful, chased by our terrier. Out back, there's a small stream feeding into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (which mostly meant chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be brutally harsh, yet there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often fought as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts to store our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played make-believe in a time when nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to quaint tourist towns. There are no large city malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Wherever you need to go, you have to drive. Despite this, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is encircled by water. On one side is the stunning Lake Michigan, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes into. My neighborhood reflects the concept of a small town. Houses aren't packed together. They aren't cookie-cutter homes. They are older houses, some of which have been updated and remodeled, while others remain as they were. Most homes have basements, full basements visible from the street. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses of every color you can imagine in the blocks around my home. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their pets. The houses reflect Middle America. Hardworking people striving to make a living and either raising families or having raised families. On any given day, you'll see children running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other, and you can recognize who belongs and who doesn’t. You'll see someone grilling outside and waving, or even someone walking their dog a few blocks away who smiles pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from the fall. Green grass is kept mowed and orderly. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed. It isn’t a neighborhood that stuns you with its beauty, but one that makes you think it would be a good place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though it looks average, it is exceptional because it represents what people want in the world: a safe place to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear announcers keeping score and calling players' names. Our small town airport is next to it. You can be playing outside or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you’re really into it, you can reach downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only about 8 blocks away. It is truly a great place to live.",
            "The general area where I live can be described as a typical cookie-cutter suburb. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. As you enter, you see only well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association. The front yards are all quite similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Occasionally, you'll also see small trees. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll notice newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or similar issues. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two-story ones as well. We don't have the typical mailbox setup you might expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments with a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. My house is located on the far edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as partly rural, partly suburban. As a result, we have a lot of land for various things. There are multiple community pools that anyone living here can access. They are well-maintained and gated. There are also various walking trails where you can walk your dog or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't need to visit a park to get your exercise. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get plenty of exercise. Most of the community consists of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we also have a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it's surprisingly large—at least in terms of population—but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities you would expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it serves its purpose. For me, it takes about 15 minutes of driving to reach anywhere significant, but once I do, I'm greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and have minimal staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain you like.",
            "The first time I learned about my place was while listening to a podcast about missing people. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment in the area was over a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard anything about that story, nor had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggles. I know some friends who cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but over the years, we've learned to be frugal. You start to appreciate the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. As an adult, you smell a lot less. Maybe you start smoking, or maybe you're just used to the state of things. But the flea market always makes itself known. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself into the leather and stays even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far side, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is dense, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you won't hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Each year, there are more of them. Cars and people flood in. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it still shows growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone and everything are focused on their own goals, and not much is asked of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where a bit of concern shows you care. Here, you don't really pry into anyone's life. You can maintain your shell as long as you like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we are less a group of strangers in an apartment and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn at funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring mail to them, and they to me. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely ruined my life.",
            "I reside in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, located on the town's east side, is considered the most economically disadvantaged part. Property values are low, with most homes rented or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Although crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of the town, they are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for occasionally having an item disappear from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. Overall, the town I live in has been significantly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" impacting many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying due to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that organizes multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Since over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have occurred in the town center and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located, and most traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is rich in culture. It sits on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a seven-story apartment building directly across from the old live theater, and a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you'll see people lined up outside waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large considering the part of town it's in. The park is encircled by concrete, with tall steps built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it does rain, and the heavy downpours in mid-winter often make it hard to keep warm. Setting up their tents close together in the city center, rather than out in the wild, helps keep them warmer. They are also within a reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historic features—the tall, proud buildings, the architecture scattered across the hills that roll down to the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious area on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories are still told about federal officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are passed from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me, about those days. The residents work hard, even though it's still considered one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city, on their block. It's said that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. I believe this warning is a remnant of the past, tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Maybe I'm just dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who is painfully aware of the issues that continually affect our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city meant to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I wander, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more often and rarely with ill intent offered me a jacket rather than rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few minutes longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest, dreariest nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, it was difficult for me to make friends, but eventually, I became close to someone who lived two houses down and another person on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who lived here when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend, or whenever it's warm, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had any issues with the people here. You're left alone unless you need assistance. I've ordered many packages online and none have been taken from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with others from the neighborhood. I also had one of my worst experiences there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, when I visit the park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park now makes me nostalgic for several reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. The most popular places are fast food spots, which are common in any suburban area. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you might need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse as well; there is an Indian-owned store if you ever want to make homemade Indian food or buy ready-made Indian dishes. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading on social media and watching the news about the horror stories others experience with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that reason, I really enjoy living there. There are mainly apartment buildings, but also some restaurants and bars that are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but the quality of service or drinks there isn't really bad. Most of the people are nice. They are either students or have a low income, since the apartments aren't very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, but I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of weed, so the management of my building placed an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very amusing. It's almost insulting. The buildings around me usually look quite old, but might have renovated interiors. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't like them because I know the construction wasn't particularly good. They're cheaply built, but the rent is high, which I think is a scam, but since they're near the campus, the building management can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and mostly microwaves their dishes. Across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was redone last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area is now a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut some of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are many more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and that one isn't as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that's probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can't blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can easily get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced and arranged to look like individual houses. The only distinction is that each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, though not all, is friends with each other. Some evenings, we gather at the end of a random driveway and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It's very refreshing in this modern, overly mechanical/computer-filled world. It's a bit like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we're experiencing tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we actually heard tornado sirens, so we had to seek shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and stayed in the living room, nervous and barking, uneasy about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the temperature change. We went from 92 to 75 degrees in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted on hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun appeared and it started to rain. A double rainbow emerged. I ran into the house, grabbed my camera, and quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets stayed quiet for another hour before some people finally returned from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was back to normal, with moms and children outside as dinner cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me who recently moved from NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as does everyone. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all the apartments are the same inside. Some are actually quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I love to walk along the largest field behind where I live and wander down to the pond that isn't meant for swimming. I have seen deer, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small community village of its own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he's there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "Since I've been here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. Initially, I was quite sad when I moved into my neighborhood. I relocated from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for my little sister and me, so we moved to a better place with improved housing and a better high school. Everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it, made some new friends, and also some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, who were right next to us. They were pleasant people I can almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I remember when my mom, dad, sister, and I went to Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried). It was really fun and enjoyable, to say the least, and it's something I look forward to someday as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the little white band on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can spend more time exploring it. I've only gone so far when hanging out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calm and peace these days. I also bring some sticks I bought from the home depot and just practice my balance, and I take my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time. It's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try again. My dad raised me and my best friend on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there have been many times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stood out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It may not stand out from others in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, a fact the town proudly displays on its welcome sign. The area is mainly composed of farmland, dominated by peach orchards or cattle pastures. Houses outside the main town area are spaced widely apart; most are two-story buildings with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Often, these homes are set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores in the town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed not long ago. There's a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, humorously best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There's also a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Although it's the only grocery store in town, many people only stop by for one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping. The most popular store in town is Dollar General, which sells a wide variety of everyday items and is often busy from opening to closing! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a friendly woman well-known in the community. The store has been a part of Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who deliver purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store is a small pet grooming business called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer various services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located away from the town's center; they are small but well-equipped to assist Johnston's residents. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After completing fifth grade, students must attend middle and high school in the next town. Technically, there are no parks in the town, but they are currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outings and to attract more visitors and potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a pleasant town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without noticing!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a street that connects two state highways, so we experience a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents. People mainly keep busy with yard work and other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the cars people drive around here. If we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to take notice. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and do the typical things you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say everyone else is used to our comings and goings too. We go outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. It seems like someone is always mowing the lawn around here, and you can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood has many trees since it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but also lots of leaves in the fall. That means raking and burning leaves every year. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves too, so it's a nice sign that fall has arrived. Recently, we haven't had much of a winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when the garage doors are open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite calm around here. During Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families visit with out-of-town guests, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same on other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through-street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is located right in the center of the high desert, where there's nothing but dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't fully understand the constant sight of brown, and when you see a lawn, it’s clear that the homeowner is spending a lot on its maintenance. When I first moved here in the 90s, houses were spread far apart. Now it's mostly the same, but with many new additions. Honestly, this place looks more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing in the same way. Most of the time, people are very friendly, but just like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly elderly folks, so I guess it's a nicer area. The stores here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale shopping, you have to travel; I hardly ever see any Whole Foods or similar stores. The most common jobs in my city, not based on any official demographics, seem to be in construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, with lots of open space to build on. That kind of worries me, as I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not eager to go back. Speaking of construction, this is the field my full-time job is in; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not least the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they’re all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs. As I write this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It offers a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to complete your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, I believe my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are likely homeowners with their own lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory are my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some similarities with more conventional neighborhood ideas. Just like any traditional neighborhood, the area I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before exploring the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people in a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so on average, there are around 20 people living in each building. Second, there are the actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. Typically, these are 2-4 bedroom setups where alumni usually live. However, there are only a few of these types of houses scattered throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorms that house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff live in the houses located in the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing and older students reside in apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be justly described only in words, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is truly its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options found in any other neighborhood and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, everything needed can be found within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people, kept clean and crime-free by all members of my neighborhood!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks in the area where I live. Everything seems to slope downward, and my house is right at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers like to run up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road has potholes in some places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and power lines strung around the block look worn. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often knock down the power lines, and the constant repairs give them a patched and checkerboard appearance. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere you look. But people here dislike the trees. They try to cut down as many as possible because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high up on the hill, with large glass-fronted second stories rising one after the other to capture the view of the bay. It's beautiful at sunset when the water seems to light up from below and the sky turns orange. However, it is mostly cloudy, so you often see most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked in my driveway for a month, and when I went to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't many children around where I live, though there is a school just a few blocks away. Most people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting on people's lawns or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, you risk them sneaking into your house. I once found one in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are quite large, and gardeners dislike them because they dig up plant roots and burrow into people's lawns. However, my cats love them and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it away. There aren't any stores nearby, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront, there are a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to throw into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can clearly see the opposite shoreline, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it! Public transport is very accessible and one of the most popular ways to travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is quite an urban neighborhood, so you'll still feel like you're in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see numerous Asian stores everywhere. Over the last two decades, Bensonhurst has seen an influx of Asian residents. Because of this, you will see at least one Asian-owned store on every block as you walk. Supermarkets and laundromats are the most popular. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents because the quality of food in the supermarkets is excellent, the prices are much cheaper, and it is very convenient. Right nearby, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other. This only adds to the convenience of grocery shopping. I'm not saying Bensonhurst is solely populated by Asian residents. It is quite diverse, with immigrants and their first and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the area are Asian-owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has about ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy in the summer. Since we are in New York City, the parks are, of course, very diverse. You'll see all sorts of people here able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you'd find are for co-op living or condominium apartments. However, most of the living spaces here are two-family houses. Most people are quite nice, but very noisy. Every day, you would hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house or constantly revving their engines, which will wake you up in the morning. If you plan to visit at night, you should be cautious. This neighborhood is quite safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might run into people who want to cause trouble for no reason, bullies, and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past through physical assault, but that was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package theft. Although it's a common issue, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has fines for not cleaning up after dogs, people here don't follow the rules. Every morning, you'll see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station or the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the ground everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, found on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts legality in at least half of these roles, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was lesser-known and less pricey, nurturing creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is an enticing call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but now as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the continuous construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't always mean accepting, but it does mean embracing things that are typically not accepted. Weird doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or contemporary struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways of being weird, of being not normal, yet Portland also has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we simply take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes with items someone is discarding, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often contain something magical, a treasure perfectly suited for someone passing by, surprisingly often. Free boxes usually have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. At least, that's what Portland is to me, but I am just one type of weird among many. Some people I live among would never dream of selecting their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or Timbers games (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all kinds of things. Portland is full of people who pursue their dreams, or dream of pursuing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug issue. Drug issues are often rooted in mental health problems, and the constant rain for much of the year, along with the dreary clouds, seems to contribute. Portland also faces a homelessness issue, which no one seems to know how to tackle. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than most parts of the country, but our services are inadequate, just like everywhere else. The non-homeless population fluctuates between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are ever-present. In the north, they observe the sun's journey at every dawn and dusk. No matter how much I forget them or how consumed I am by work and life to notice, they remain steadfast, unchallenged, and indifferent to life's troubles. On days when I am most stressed and tense, they insist on being noticed, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of the campus were what initially captivated me. The university indeed has its fair share of breathtaking sights in its buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold part of my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own way. Countless cafés have been home to many hours of caffeine-driven studying. One can walk or take a bus a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks lining the restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and energy as its neighboring urban city. However, this doesn't last for many blocks, as one can once again escape to the serene small town by passing the library. This juxtaposition of atmospheres in such close proximity gives this city a wondrous vibe, as if it beckons to be explored. With this, it's easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a particular part of town. Whether it's walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the busy downtown to catch a movie at the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places inevitably are in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as for crying sessions at two in the morning during an existential crisis. The latter is something I have more experience with. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live their lives, each contributing or playing a role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this enigma called life. So, I walked past the pond, past the park and the little houses that epitomize suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays over the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they always had been. The imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred within me a sense of perseverance.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it—after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not typically where you'd expect to find places to live. At least, not places most would choose to live in. But if you venture past the old, abandoned Whole Foods and behind the hotels, which are only occupied annually except for a few summer stints for family reunions, you will discover a bustling community. On these streets, within these communities, are a handful of apartment complexes—carefully lined up next to each other like Russian nesting dolls, meticulously taken apart and placed side by side along the road. The first apartments you encounter have been in the news for some rather unsavory incidents, so let's not dwell on those—appearances can be deceiving, after all. However, the apartments next to that complex, and the two beside them, belong to a completely different world that almost no one in the area knows about. Across from these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college—a quiet, sleepy cluster of buildings standing sentinel by the road, where students trickle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning as they begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan about the traffic when attendance is higher. The road leads into another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones under unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Across the street at the park, children run back and forth on the grass, doing cartwheels and somersaults over the prickly green blades while bees lazily buzz around the flower patches by the road. Retired folks walk their dogs along the path, frowning at teenagers on skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park with inexpensive food that never seems too busy—a swimming supply store right beside it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could prepare your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken—all at once, the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place there, one of those DIY types, and you often see teens in the park holding cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while performing tricks on their skateboards and vaping because they believe it's the coolest thing. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where almost nothing changes, not even time.",
            "My neighborhood is quite interesting. While most of the houses are single-family, a few have been divided into two units, yet remain attached, if that makes sense. My home features a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. Like most others, it evokes a time not too long ago when suburban life was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this nation, but now it seems to be slipping away. However, my neighborhood and many others still persist, still calling out to us and visitors that the dream is alive, and we are clinging to it as best as we can. The people don't feel as hopeful as they once did, the upkeep of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth still play as if their surroundings were their entire world. The public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, igniting a future in today's young people, while stirring nostalgia among older residents. The churches are few and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. All the homes look different, yet they feel the same. A large supermarket called Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, who might be the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the residents are African American. The streets are broad, and kids usually play football, pausing only to let cars through. Many in my neighborhood have been here for generations and can share stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest in being the Karate Kid, so now it's a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discount, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders, who find it a small cost for a night out, without the kids of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, but the elders disagreed. They believed that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, convincing the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",
            "Since I live in a big city, my neighborhood is quite diverse. Residential areas are scattered, seemingly at random, among commercial zones where various businesses operate. Some of these businesses include offices, while others are shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new places to eat or shop. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are also gaining popularity. They are not only located in malls but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene if not surrounded by so many attractions. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I've noticed that people often visit these parks with their young children. Regarding the people, there is indeed quite a bit of diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a mix of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Extending a bit further outside my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they sometimes form their own small communities within the city. We have places known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, just a few miles can mean a very long drive. Covering only 10 miles can sometimes take two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere. While certain points of interest are inevitably close, the city is huge, and people generally do not prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be hard to find parking spots almost anywhere. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction in recent years, with large apartment buildings being added to the city. It seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the idea of even more people moving in and more vehicles on the roads. However, there are many different types of housing in my city. Not everyone lives or wants to live in a large apartment building. Residential areas consist of houses of different sizes, as well as smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, while others have duplexes. This is true even within my immediate neighborhood, so there is no lack of diversity regarding housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of various ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with most of my neighbors. It is not really a close-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood who were all close to my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she would be shocked by the openness of the landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was only a five-minute walk from her house—she had never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the omnipresent cornfields, I described to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you reach a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development where I live. The houses are mainly made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, perennial flowers abound, along with Midwest trees that change with the seasons. The driveways are filled with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. Continuing along the road to my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly demeanor. He often spends the day mowing his lawn, his singing audible over the mower's hum. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him amusing, yet he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has aged and lost some of his sharpness over time. In his past, he was a doctor and often blends into the grass with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you reach my home. In the side yard, geese are plentiful, chased by our terrier. Out back, there's a small stream feeding into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (which mostly meant chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be brutally harsh, yet there's nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers become barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. My sister and I often fought as kids, and in winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We built massive igloo-like forts to store our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland, we played make-believe in a time when nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world."
