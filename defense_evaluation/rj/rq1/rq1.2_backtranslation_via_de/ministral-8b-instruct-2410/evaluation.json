            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed with commercial areas, where a variety of businesses operate. These include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is no shortage of places to eat or shop. While larger, well-known brands are prevalent, small boutiques are also gaining popularity and are not limited to shopping malls; they line the streets, often within walking distance of quieter residential areas. There are also nearby parks where you can often find people with their young children. Speaking of the people, our neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further afield, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, sometimes living in their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, all just a few miles away. However, a mere 10 miles can take two hours to traverse due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in the city, despite some attractions being nearby. The city is vast, and most people prefer to drive or use public transportation. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings being added. It's a popular destination, but many residents are dismayed by the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in the city. Not everyone lives in large apartment buildings; there are houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some contain single-family homes, while others are duplexes. This diversity extends to my immediate neighborhood, with people of all ages. While I'm not close with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends who lived nearby.",
            "My Nachbarschaft ist interessant. Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber es gibt auch einige, die in zwei Wohnungen geteilt wurden, aber noch immer aneinanderhängen, falls das Sinn macht. Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Vorgarten und eine kleine Einfahrt zur linken Seite des Hauses. Es, wie die meisten anderen, erinnert an eine Zeit, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien die Menschen dieses Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt nimmt er sich zunehmend zurück. Aber in meiner Nachbarschaft und vielen anderen bleibt die Träume noch wach, und wir halten sie so gut es geht fest. Die Menschen sind nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, der Unterhalt der kleinen Vorgärten ist nicht mehr so, wie es einmal war, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Jugend spielt, als ob die Welt um sie herum die ganze Welt ist. Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre hier steht, scheint den heutigen Jugendlichen eine Zukunft vorzuspielen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind weit und breit, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, aber sie fühlen sich gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die möglicherweise die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft sind. Der überwiegende Teil der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind schon Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten aus einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood aufhörte, Karate Kid Filme zu machen, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, weil Drogen alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem reduzierten Preis spielt, das von den Jugendlichen gemieden wird wegen ihrer Vorliebe für aktuelle Titel, aber von den Älteren geschätzt wird, die für einen Abend ohne Kinder einen kleinen Preis zahlen. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch unsere Stadt führt. Die Ausfahrt und der Einfahrt sind in der Stadt neben uns. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte sie, während die Älteren ablehnten. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße unsere Stadt ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich die Stadtverwaltung überredet haben, die Anfrage abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool, und wir entscheiden gerade über ein Maskottchen für unsere Stadt. Ich denke, ein Cyborg mit einem ländlichen Akzent und einer Blockhütte wäre die beste Darstellung unserer Stadt.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would expect to find places to live. At least, not places that most people would want to call home. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels that are only occupied annually, except for a few summer weeks for family reunions, you'll discover an entire thriving community. Within these communities, on these streets, are several apartment complexes - arranged neatly beside each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first apartments you come across have been in the news for some dubious activities, so we won't delve into those too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside it, are a world apart that almost no one living in this area knows about. On the other side of those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, peaceful set of buildings standing guard beside the road, where students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters honk and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate accidents. The treatment center features cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, doing cartwheels and flip-flops across the prickly green blades while bees lazily buzz in the flower beds by the road. Senior folks walk their dogs on the walking path, glaring at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that offers affordable food but never gets too crowded - a swimming supply store next to it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the charm of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop there, the DIY kind, and you often see teens in the park holding cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with toppings while they perform stunts on their skateboards and vape because they think it's cool. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where barely anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, während wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” antwortete ich, wissend, dass sie erschrecken würde über die Einsamkeit der offenen Landschaft. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte noch nie so viel offenes Land gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr von meinem Aufwachsen in ländlichem Ohio, und in diesem Moment erkannte sie, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Als wir die zweispurige Landstraße entlangfuhren, erreichten wir einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Just dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sind mostly aus Backstein und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Morgen Land, auf das sich jeder stolz pflegt. Im Frühlingszeit gibt es überall eine Fülle von jährlich gepflanzten Blumen sowie mittelhöfischen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit hochwertigen Mercedes-Benz Luxuswagen gefüllt, die nach einem guten, alten Autowasch glänzen. Weiter auf dem Weg zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines Rasenmähers gehört werden. Alle im Viertel lachen über ihn, aber er ist immer ehrlich und eine wunderbare Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit den Jahren hat er etwas von seinem Verstand verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere Zero-Turn-Mäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden.Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Moo” von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke hinweg ist ein unberührter Oase mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier habe ich meine Kindheit verbracht. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum “Jagen” von Tieren (was mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), war immer etwas zu tun und meist ein Nachbarskind zur Freundschaft bereit. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Hof verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einmal lebhafte pink, purple und orange Blumen trugen, verwandeln sich in karge Rindenstämme. Bei seltener Schneefall verwandelt sich der Winter in eine Winterwunderwelt. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneeengeln, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat, und Schneemännern gesäumt. Mein Geschwister und ich haben uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige igloidenartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, normalerweise mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Paradies spielten wir vor, in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.",
            "The first thing to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, printed on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and often toes the legal line, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is now a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of things that are usually not accepted. It doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences or modern issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure perfectly suited for the person wandering by, surprising the recipient often. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That's what Portland means to me, but I'm only one variety of weird among many. Some people I live among would never consider picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from (at their core) mental health problems, and the constant rain throughout much of the year, along with the overcast skies, seem to contribute. Portland also faces a homelessness problem, which seems to have no clear solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up I am with work and life, they are there, steadfast, resolute, and untroubled by life's vicissitudes. Then, on days when I am the most stressed and frazzled, they demand to be noticed, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, day by day. I first moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of campus were what first captivated me. While the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also have their place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly hold sway. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés where I spent many hours fueled by caffeine and cramming. One can walk or take the bus a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an atmosphere of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town reveals its dynamism, as lively and vibrant as its neighboring urban city. This thriving energy doesn't last for many blocks, however, as one can escape once again to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderous vibe, as if it is beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions in the middle of the night during an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have done more than once. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, each with some role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this enigma called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's brilliant rays shone atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during nighttime, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Es gibt nicht viele Bürgersteige in meiner Nachbarschaft. Alles scheint bergab zu strömen, und mein Haus liegt genau am Kamm des steilsten Hügels der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Trainingshügel\", weil so viele Jogger jeden Tag daran vorbeilaufen. Da es in meiner Straße keine Bürgersteige gibt, geht jeder auf der Straße. Diese Straße ist an einigen Stellen mit Schlaglöchern übersät und kann gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Elektrokabel, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerlumpt aus. Es regnet und stürmt in unserer Gegend oft, sodass Äste und anderes Gerümpel die Stromleitungen herunterzischen und die ständigen Reparaturen sie unordentlich und bunt aussehen lassen. Es gibt viele hohe Kiefern in der Nähe, wohin man auch schaut. Aber die Menschen hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Ausblick auf den Ozean versperren. Deswegen sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit großen, verglasten zweiten Etagen, die sich nacheinander erheben, um den Ausblick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist um Sonnenuntergang herum wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten erleuchtet zu werden scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber oft bewölkt, sodass man die meiste Sonne durch Nebel sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal ließ ich meinen Wagen einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt stehen und als ich ihn uso er ausgefahren wollte, war er von Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte drei Stunden, um es alle abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nachbarschaft, obwohl sich eine Schule nur wenige Blocks entfernt befindet. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter und viele von ihnen sind pensioniert. Anstelle von Kindern haben die meisten Leute Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Vorgärten oder auf der Straße zu sehen, wie sie hintereinander herrennen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus schlüpfen. Einmal fand ich einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn zur Vordertür hinausscheuchen. Kaninchen wildern in der Gegend herum. Einige sind groß und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in den Rasenlöcher buddeln. Meine Katzen lieben sie aber und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir haben auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris und manchmal sieht man auch einen Habicht oder Adler, der von den neighborhood Krähen verscheucht wird. Es gibt keine Läden in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinabwandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants am Wasserfront, die frischen Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind lustig zum Werfen in das Wasser. Die Bucht ist nicht besonders breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste klar durch den Nebel sehen.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people who live here. Most people spend their time on yardwork and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and all that you would expect from a neighborhood. We are home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged 11 and 14. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue. It seems like someone is always cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there are also a lot of leaves in the Fall, which means raking and burning leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we haven't had much winter, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Final English translation: My neighborhood is smack in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably don’t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but supposedly most places are changing the same way. Most of the time, the people are very friendly, but just like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people; I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are mostly chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale, you have to travel; I never really see any Whole Foods or places of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, I would say, are based on construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there are still a lot of wide-open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's also the field my full-time job is located in, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.",
            "Wenn ich gefragt werde, wie ich meinen Wohnbezirk beschreiben soll, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigenheimbesitzer sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als den Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch den umliegenden Campus betrachte ich als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in einem geringeren Maße. Trotz dieser Eigenartigkeit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den herkömmlichen Vorstellungen von einem Wohnbezirk. So wie jeder herkömmliche Wohnbezirk hat auch mein Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich die Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk genauer betrachte, ist es am besten, die verschiedenen Hausarten zu klären, die in meiner direkten Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Umgebung: Apartments, ursprüngliche Häuser und Wohnheimhäuser. In den Apartments leben normalerweise 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume pro Stockwerk. Das gängigste Gebäude kann 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die ursprünglichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Schulbindung zur Miete erhältlich sind. Diese sind in der Regel 2-4 Schlafzimmer groß und beherbergen normalerweise Absolventen, es gibt aber nur wenige solcher Häuser im Wohnbezirk, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, in denen Hunderte von Schülern untergebracht sind. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahme weniger, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterkunft in meinem Wohnbezirk. Mit der Unterkunftsbekanntmachung sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und diese zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersklassen, die in meinem Wohnbezirk leben. Die meisten Fachkräfte leben in den Häusern, die im Wohnbezirk platziert sind, während die jüngeren Schüler in der Wohnheimunterkunft und die älteren Schüler in der Apartmentunterkunft leben. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk lassen sich nicht einfach durch ihre Beschreibung gerecht werden, daher ist es am besten, zu den Geschäften und Parks in meinem Wohnbezirk überzugehen. Da meine Schule fast vollständig autark ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte bieten eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jedem anderen Wohnbezirk finden würde, und die eigenen Marken von Schulkleidung und Lebensmitteln. So kann man in den Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks alles finden! Außerdem ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für alle vielfältigen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk, er wird von allen Bewohnern sauber gehalten und ist frei von Kriminalität!",
            "Well, since I’ve been living here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. First off, I was quite sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t lie, I cried because I missed them and I loved them, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better neighborhood with better housing and a better high school. Everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved here. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends, and even some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived right next door. They were great people I almost considered family, and I truly appreciated them. I remember when my mom, dad, my sister, and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got re-married). It was a lot of fun and a great time, and I’m looking forward to something similar for myself someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mrs. Glen, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap from her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the flowers. We danced the whole night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since, but I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that’s where I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and just enjoy life to the fullest that we could. Sometimes I’d go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. It gives me a sense of peace. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my wooden bokken sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time. It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try it again. My dad and my best friend used to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. There are many times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stand out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and I quite enjoy living here. The area is mostly apartment buildings, but there are several restaurants and bars that are fun and affordable. One of them recently changed its name and became a bit more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is quite affordable. There's an elementary school within walking distance, and I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t mind. They sometimes smoke weed, so the building management put an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings around me are quite old but might have had interior renovations. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but I don't like them because the construction quality is poor, and the rent is expensive. Nonetheless, the area has improved with a new road and sidewalk, along with city-funded landscaping. The apartment complex I live in is surrounded by trees, which have been trimmed, leaving some stumps. Behind my complex is another tree line and a set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and right behind is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and many buildings look run-down. There are plenty of trees here, perhaps as a means of hiding the buildings' appearance. Crime has occurred in the apartment complex on this street, but I can't blame just them, as there are also some issues across the street from me. Despite these issues, I like living here as it is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university's proximity and the two bus stops, which make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced and arranged intermittently to look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern, all-too-mechanical/computer-filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and, for the first time last night, we actually heard actual tornado sirens, so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the living room, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all over the ground. After the storm, the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, moms and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved from NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two-bedroom and two-bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of its own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not particularly notable, but it's significant for agriculture, especially peaches. Johnston is proudly known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and the town proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses outside the main area are spaced far apart, either with metal roofs to cool the summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road to use the front fields for animals or crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where all the stores are located. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a burger chain, and a closed-down pizzeria. There's also a small, family-owned pharmacy famous for Cherry Coca-Cola, an expensive grocery store, and a busy Dollar General store. There's a small furniture store run by a kind woman, along with a pet grooming service. The town has a single elementary school, and for middle and high school, students must go to the next town over. There are no parks, but a recreational area is being planned. There's not much to do, but it's a pleasant, small town that you can easily miss!",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as typical cookie cutter suburbia. In particular, my neighborhood shows a strong influence from a homeowner's association. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition with no potholes. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single family homes. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "Ich lebe in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die direkt am Rand der Vororte einer Großstadt liegt. Mein direkter Wohnbezirk auf der Ostseite der Stadt könnte als die am meisten wirtschaftlich benachteiligte Gegend der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, und die majority der Häuser werden an wohnungslose oder niedrige Einkommenshaushalte vermietet oder verkauft. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind in der Regel freundliche Menschen, die mir zulächeln und „Hallo“ sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, bleibt aber insgesamt niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es einige gewalttätige Kriminalfälle in der Nähe meines Zuhauses, darunter einige Schießereien und mindestens ein Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letzten Jahr ihren Sohn bei einem Schuss vor einer Bar in der Nähe. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie bis jetzt keine direkten Auswirkungen von Kriminalität erlebt, außer dass hin und wieder mal ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir es vergessen, ins Haus zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen hat die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark unter der „Opioid-Epidemie“ gelitten, die viele Teile der USA betrifft. Viele Leben wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um gegen diese Epidemie vorzugehen, darunter mehrere Entzugsbehandlungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Betroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat die Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ausgezeichnetes Personal, von der Schulleitung bis zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er bisher keine Mobbing erlebt, und er liebt die Schule wegen der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre. Es gibt eine aktive Eltern-Lehrer-Vereinigung, die mehrere Veranstaltungen im Jahr plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den schulischen Fortschritt zu fördern. Da mehr als 20 % der Bevölkerung der Stadt unter der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlos Frühstück und Mittagessen an, sodass kein Kind hungrig nach Hause geht. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird aufgrund seiner oder ihrer Zahlungsunfähigkeit als „weniger wert“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Schulmaterialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen am Aussehen der Stadt vorgenommen, darunter das Asphaltieren von Straßen, die Landschaftsgestaltung und die Renovierung städtischer Parks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und im Westen stattgefunden, wo sich alle Einkaufsbereiche und die majority des Verkehrs befinden. Der Osten, wo ich lebe, wird vernachlässigt, was in meiner Nachbarschaft eine Quelle der Anerkennung ist. Insgesamt genieße ich das Leben in dieser Stadt. Die Leute sind in der Regel freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (Klein- und Großgeschäfte) für die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie und unser Haus mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und wir können uns keinen anderen Ort vorstellen.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill is this cool little arcade bar that attracts different types of people, especially on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large given the part of town it is in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall stairs set into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains a lot, and the heavy rain in the mid-winter months often makes it difficult to stay warm. Setting their tents close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They are also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature—the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am dark enough to be mistaken for someone who is not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most grey and dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "Translation back to English:\nI live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there's no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Everywhere you need to go, you have to drive. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren't cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them updated and remodeled, some are older. Most homes have basements that are visible from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. There are houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and play sets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hardworking people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day, you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in good condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average-looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed with commercial areas, where a variety of businesses operate. These include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is no shortage of places to eat or shop. While larger, well-known brands are prevalent, small boutiques are also gaining popularity and are not limited to shopping malls; they line the streets, often within walking distance of quieter residential areas. There are also nearby parks where you can often find people with their young children. Speaking of the people, our neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further afield, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, sometimes living in their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, all just a few miles away. However, a mere 10 miles can take two hours to traverse due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in the city, despite some attractions being nearby. The city is vast, and most people prefer to drive or use public transportation. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings being added. It's a popular destination, but many residents are dismayed by the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in the city. Not everyone lives in large apartment buildings; there are houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some contain single-family homes, while others are duplexes. This diversity extends to my immediate neighborhood, with people of all ages. While I'm not close with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends who lived nearby.",
            "My Nachbarschaft ist interessant. Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber es gibt auch einige, die in zwei Wohnungen geteilt wurden, aber noch immer aneinanderhängen, falls das Sinn macht. Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Vorgarten und eine kleine Einfahrt zur linken Seite des Hauses. Es, wie die meisten anderen, erinnert an eine Zeit, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien die Menschen dieses Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt nimmt er sich zunehmend zurück. Aber in meiner Nachbarschaft und vielen anderen bleibt die Träume noch wach, und wir halten sie so gut es geht fest. Die Menschen sind nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, der Unterhalt der kleinen Vorgärten ist nicht mehr so, wie es einmal war, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Jugend spielt, als ob die Welt um sie herum die ganze Welt ist. Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre hier steht, scheint den heutigen Jugendlichen eine Zukunft vorzuspielen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind weit und breit, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, aber sie fühlen sich gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die möglicherweise die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft sind. Der überwiegende Teil der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind schon Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten aus einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood aufhörte, Karate Kid Filme zu machen, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, weil Drogen alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem reduzierten Preis spielt, das von den Jugendlichen gemieden wird wegen ihrer Vorliebe für aktuelle Titel, aber von den Älteren geschätzt wird, die für einen Abend ohne Kinder einen kleinen Preis zahlen. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch unsere Stadt führt. Die Ausfahrt und der Einfahrt sind in der Stadt neben uns. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte sie, während die Älteren ablehnten. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße unsere Stadt ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich die Stadtverwaltung überredet haben, die Anfrage abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool, und wir entscheiden gerade über ein Maskottchen für unsere Stadt. Ich denke, ein Cyborg mit einem ländlichen Akzent und einer Blockhütte wäre die beste Darstellung unserer Stadt.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would expect to find places to live. At least, not places that most people would want to call home. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels that are only occupied annually, except for a few summer weeks for family reunions, you'll discover an entire thriving community. Within these communities, on these streets, are several apartment complexes - arranged neatly beside each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first apartments you come across have been in the news for some dubious activities, so we won't delve into those too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside it, are a world apart that almost no one living in this area knows about. On the other side of those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, peaceful set of buildings standing guard beside the road, where students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters honk and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate accidents. The treatment center features cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, doing cartwheels and flip-flops across the prickly green blades while bees lazily buzz in the flower beds by the road. Senior folks walk their dogs on the walking path, glaring at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that offers affordable food but never gets too crowded - a swimming supply store next to it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the charm of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop there, the DIY kind, and you often see teens in the park holding cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with toppings while they perform stunts on their skateboards and vape because they think it's cool. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where barely anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, während wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” antwortete ich, wissend, dass sie erschrecken würde über die Einsamkeit der offenen Landschaft. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte noch nie so viel offenes Land gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr von meinem Aufwachsen in ländlichem Ohio, und in diesem Moment erkannte sie, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Als wir die zweispurige Landstraße entlangfuhren, erreichten wir einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Just dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sind mostly aus Backstein und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Morgen Land, auf das sich jeder stolz pflegt. Im Frühlingszeit gibt es überall eine Fülle von jährlich gepflanzten Blumen sowie mittelhöfischen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit hochwertigen Mercedes-Benz Luxuswagen gefüllt, die nach einem guten, alten Autowasch glänzen. Weiter auf dem Weg zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines Rasenmähers gehört werden. Alle im Viertel lachen über ihn, aber er ist immer ehrlich und eine wunderbare Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit den Jahren hat er etwas von seinem Verstand verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere Zero-Turn-Mäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden.Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Moo” von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke hinweg ist ein unberührter Oase mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier habe ich meine Kindheit verbracht. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum “Jagen” von Tieren (was mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), war immer etwas zu tun und meist ein Nachbarskind zur Freundschaft bereit. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Hof verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einmal lebhafte pink, purple und orange Blumen trugen, verwandeln sich in karge Rindenstämme. Bei seltener Schneefall verwandelt sich der Winter in eine Winterwunderwelt. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneeengeln, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat, und Schneemännern gesäumt. Mein Geschwister und ich haben uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige igloidenartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, normalerweise mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Paradies spielten wir vor, in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.",
            "The first thing to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, printed on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and often toes the legal line, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is now a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of things that are usually not accepted. It doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences or modern issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure perfectly suited for the person wandering by, surprising the recipient often. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That's what Portland means to me, but I'm only one variety of weird among many. Some people I live among would never consider picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from (at their core) mental health problems, and the constant rain throughout much of the year, along with the overcast skies, seem to contribute. Portland also faces a homelessness problem, which seems to have no clear solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up I am with work and life, they are there, steadfast, resolute, and untroubled by life's vicissitudes. Then, on days when I am the most stressed and frazzled, they demand to be noticed, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, day by day. I first moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of campus were what first captivated me. While the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also have their place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly hold sway. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés where I spent many hours fueled by caffeine and cramming. One can walk or take the bus a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an atmosphere of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town reveals its dynamism, as lively and vibrant as its neighboring urban city. This thriving energy doesn't last for many blocks, however, as one can escape once again to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderous vibe, as if it is beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions in the middle of the night during an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have done more than once. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, each with some role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this enigma called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's brilliant rays shone atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during nighttime, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Es gibt nicht viele Bürgersteige in meiner Nachbarschaft. Alles scheint bergab zu strömen, und mein Haus liegt genau am Kamm des steilsten Hügels der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Trainingshügel\", weil so viele Jogger jeden Tag daran vorbeilaufen. Da es in meiner Straße keine Bürgersteige gibt, geht jeder auf der Straße. Diese Straße ist an einigen Stellen mit Schlaglöchern übersät und kann gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Elektrokabel, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerlumpt aus. Es regnet und stürmt in unserer Gegend oft, sodass Äste und anderes Gerümpel die Stromleitungen herunterzischen und die ständigen Reparaturen sie unordentlich und bunt aussehen lassen. Es gibt viele hohe Kiefern in der Nähe, wohin man auch schaut. Aber die Menschen hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Ausblick auf den Ozean versperren. Deswegen sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit großen, verglasten zweiten Etagen, die sich nacheinander erheben, um den Ausblick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist um Sonnenuntergang herum wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten erleuchtet zu werden scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber oft bewölkt, sodass man die meiste Sonne durch Nebel sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal ließ ich meinen Wagen einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt stehen und als ich ihn uso er ausgefahren wollte, war er von Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte drei Stunden, um es alle abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nachbarschaft, obwohl sich eine Schule nur wenige Blocks entfernt befindet. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter und viele von ihnen sind pensioniert. Anstelle von Kindern haben die meisten Leute Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Vorgärten oder auf der Straße zu sehen, wie sie hintereinander herrennen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus schlüpfen. Einmal fand ich einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn zur Vordertür hinausscheuchen. Kaninchen wildern in der Gegend herum. Einige sind groß und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in den Rasenlöcher buddeln. Meine Katzen lieben sie aber und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir haben auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris und manchmal sieht man auch einen Habicht oder Adler, der von den neighborhood Krähen verscheucht wird. Es gibt keine Läden in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinabwandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants am Wasserfront, die frischen Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind lustig zum Werfen in das Wasser. Die Bucht ist nicht besonders breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste klar durch den Nebel sehen.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people who live here. Most people spend their time on yardwork and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and all that you would expect from a neighborhood. We are home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged 11 and 14. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue. It seems like someone is always cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there are also a lot of leaves in the Fall, which means raking and burning leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we haven't had much winter, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Final English translation: My neighborhood is smack in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably don’t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but supposedly most places are changing the same way. Most of the time, the people are very friendly, but just like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people; I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are mostly chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale, you have to travel; I never really see any Whole Foods or places of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, I would say, are based on construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there are still a lot of wide-open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's also the field my full-time job is located in, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.",
            "Wenn ich gefragt werde, wie ich meinen Wohnbezirk beschreiben soll, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigenheimbesitzer sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als den Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch den umliegenden Campus betrachte ich als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in einem geringeren Maße. Trotz dieser Eigenartigkeit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den herkömmlichen Vorstellungen von einem Wohnbezirk. So wie jeder herkömmliche Wohnbezirk hat auch mein Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich die Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk genauer betrachte, ist es am besten, die verschiedenen Hausarten zu klären, die in meiner direkten Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Umgebung: Apartments, ursprüngliche Häuser und Wohnheimhäuser. In den Apartments leben normalerweise 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume pro Stockwerk. Das gängigste Gebäude kann 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die ursprünglichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Schulbindung zur Miete erhältlich sind. Diese sind in der Regel 2-4 Schlafzimmer groß und beherbergen normalerweise Absolventen, es gibt aber nur wenige solcher Häuser im Wohnbezirk, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, in denen Hunderte von Schülern untergebracht sind. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahme weniger, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterkunft in meinem Wohnbezirk. Mit der Unterkunftsbekanntmachung sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und diese zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersklassen, die in meinem Wohnbezirk leben. Die meisten Fachkräfte leben in den Häusern, die im Wohnbezirk platziert sind, während die jüngeren Schüler in der Wohnheimunterkunft und die älteren Schüler in der Apartmentunterkunft leben. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk lassen sich nicht einfach durch ihre Beschreibung gerecht werden, daher ist es am besten, zu den Geschäften und Parks in meinem Wohnbezirk überzugehen. Da meine Schule fast vollständig autark ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte bieten eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jedem anderen Wohnbezirk finden würde, und die eigenen Marken von Schulkleidung und Lebensmitteln. So kann man in den Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks alles finden! Außerdem ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für alle vielfältigen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk, er wird von allen Bewohnern sauber gehalten und ist frei von Kriminalität!",
            "Well, since I’ve been living here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. First off, I was quite sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t lie, I cried because I missed them and I loved them, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better neighborhood with better housing and a better high school. Everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved here. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends, and even some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived right next door. They were great people I almost considered family, and I truly appreciated them. I remember when my mom, dad, my sister, and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got re-married). It was a lot of fun and a great time, and I’m looking forward to something similar for myself someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mrs. Glen, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap from her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the flowers. We danced the whole night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since, but I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that’s where I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and just enjoy life to the fullest that we could. Sometimes I’d go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. It gives me a sense of peace. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my wooden bokken sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time. It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try it again. My dad and my best friend used to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. There are many times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stand out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and I quite enjoy living here. The area is mostly apartment buildings, but there are several restaurants and bars that are fun and affordable. One of them recently changed its name and became a bit more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is quite affordable. There's an elementary school within walking distance, and I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t mind. They sometimes smoke weed, so the building management put an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings around me are quite old but might have had interior renovations. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but I don't like them because the construction quality is poor, and the rent is expensive. Nonetheless, the area has improved with a new road and sidewalk, along with city-funded landscaping. The apartment complex I live in is surrounded by trees, which have been trimmed, leaving some stumps. Behind my complex is another tree line and a set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and right behind is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and many buildings look run-down. There are plenty of trees here, perhaps as a means of hiding the buildings' appearance. Crime has occurred in the apartment complex on this street, but I can't blame just them, as there are also some issues across the street from me. Despite these issues, I like living here as it is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university's proximity and the two bus stops, which make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced and arranged intermittently to look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern, all-too-mechanical/computer-filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and, for the first time last night, we actually heard actual tornado sirens, so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the living room, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all over the ground. After the storm, the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, moms and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved from NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two-bedroom and two-bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of its own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not particularly notable, but it's significant for agriculture, especially peaches. Johnston is proudly known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and the town proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses outside the main area are spaced far apart, either with metal roofs to cool the summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road to use the front fields for animals or crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where all the stores are located. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a burger chain, and a closed-down pizzeria. There's also a small, family-owned pharmacy famous for Cherry Coca-Cola, an expensive grocery store, and a busy Dollar General store. There's a small furniture store run by a kind woman, along with a pet grooming service. The town has a single elementary school, and for middle and high school, students must go to the next town over. There are no parks, but a recreational area is being planned. There's not much to do, but it's a pleasant, small town that you can easily miss!",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as typical cookie cutter suburbia. In particular, my neighborhood shows a strong influence from a homeowner's association. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition with no potholes. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single family homes. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "Ich lebe in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die direkt am Rand der Vororte einer Großstadt liegt. Mein direkter Wohnbezirk auf der Ostseite der Stadt könnte als die am meisten wirtschaftlich benachteiligte Gegend der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, und die majority der Häuser werden an wohnungslose oder niedrige Einkommenshaushalte vermietet oder verkauft. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind in der Regel freundliche Menschen, die mir zulächeln und „Hallo“ sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, bleibt aber insgesamt niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es einige gewalttätige Kriminalfälle in der Nähe meines Zuhauses, darunter einige Schießereien und mindestens ein Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letzten Jahr ihren Sohn bei einem Schuss vor einer Bar in der Nähe. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie bis jetzt keine direkten Auswirkungen von Kriminalität erlebt, außer dass hin und wieder mal ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir es vergessen, ins Haus zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen hat die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark unter der „Opioid-Epidemie“ gelitten, die viele Teile der USA betrifft. Viele Leben wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um gegen diese Epidemie vorzugehen, darunter mehrere Entzugsbehandlungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Betroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat die Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ausgezeichnetes Personal, von der Schulleitung bis zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er bisher keine Mobbing erlebt, und er liebt die Schule wegen der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre. Es gibt eine aktive Eltern-Lehrer-Vereinigung, die mehrere Veranstaltungen im Jahr plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den schulischen Fortschritt zu fördern. Da mehr als 20 % der Bevölkerung der Stadt unter der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlos Frühstück und Mittagessen an, sodass kein Kind hungrig nach Hause geht. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird aufgrund seiner oder ihrer Zahlungsunfähigkeit als „weniger wert“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Schulmaterialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen am Aussehen der Stadt vorgenommen, darunter das Asphaltieren von Straßen, die Landschaftsgestaltung und die Renovierung städtischer Parks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und im Westen stattgefunden, wo sich alle Einkaufsbereiche und die majority des Verkehrs befinden. Der Osten, wo ich lebe, wird vernachlässigt, was in meiner Nachbarschaft eine Quelle der Anerkennung ist. Insgesamt genieße ich das Leben in dieser Stadt. Die Leute sind in der Regel freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (Klein- und Großgeschäfte) für die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie und unser Haus mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und wir können uns keinen anderen Ort vorstellen.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill is this cool little arcade bar that attracts different types of people, especially on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large given the part of town it is in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall stairs set into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains a lot, and the heavy rain in the mid-winter months often makes it difficult to stay warm. Setting their tents close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They are also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature—the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am dark enough to be mistaken for someone who is not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most grey and dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "Translation back to English:\nI live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there's no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Everywhere you need to go, you have to drive. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren't cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them updated and remodeled, some are older. Most homes have basements that are visible from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. There are houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and play sets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hardworking people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day, you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in good condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average-looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are interspersed with commercial areas, where a variety of businesses operate. These include offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There is no shortage of places to eat or shop. While larger, well-known brands are prevalent, small boutiques are also gaining popularity and are not limited to shopping malls; they line the streets, often within walking distance of quieter residential areas. There are also nearby parks where you can often find people with their young children. Speaking of the people, our neighborhood is quite diverse. In a small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further afield, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, sometimes living in their own small communities within the city. We have areas like Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and more, all just a few miles away. However, a mere 10 miles can take two hours to traverse due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Few people walk anywhere in the city, despite some attractions being nearby. The city is vast, and most people prefer to drive or use public transportation. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic congestion and parking issues. Ironically, there has been a lot of construction recently, with new apartment buildings being added. It's a popular destination, but many residents are dismayed by the prospect of more people and vehicles. There are various types of housing in the city. Not everyone lives in large apartment buildings; there are houses of different sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some contain single-family homes, while others are duplexes. This diversity extends to my immediate neighborhood, with people of all ages. While I'm not close with most of my neighbors, I have fond childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends who lived nearby.",
            "My Nachbarschaft ist interessant. Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber es gibt auch einige, die in zwei Wohnungen geteilt wurden, aber noch immer aneinanderhängen, falls das Sinn macht. Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Vorgarten und eine kleine Einfahrt zur linken Seite des Hauses. Es, wie die meisten anderen, erinnert an eine Zeit, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien die Menschen dieses Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt nimmt er sich zunehmend zurück. Aber in meiner Nachbarschaft und vielen anderen bleibt die Träume noch wach, und wir halten sie so gut es geht fest. Die Menschen sind nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, der Unterhalt der kleinen Vorgärten ist nicht mehr so, wie es einmal war, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Jugend spielt, als ob die Welt um sie herum die ganze Welt ist. Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre hier steht, scheint den heutigen Jugendlichen eine Zukunft vorzuspielen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind weit und breit, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, aber sie fühlen sich gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die möglicherweise die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft sind. Der überwiegende Teil der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind schon Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten aus einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood aufhörte, Karate Kid Filme zu machen, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, weil Drogen alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem reduzierten Preis spielt, das von den Jugendlichen gemieden wird wegen ihrer Vorliebe für aktuelle Titel, aber von den Älteren geschätzt wird, die für einen Abend ohne Kinder einen kleinen Preis zahlen. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch unsere Stadt führt. Die Ausfahrt und der Einfahrt sind in der Stadt neben uns. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte sie, während die Älteren ablehnten. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße unsere Stadt ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich die Stadtverwaltung überredet haben, die Anfrage abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool, und wir entscheiden gerade über ein Maskottchen für unsere Stadt. Ich denke, ein Cyborg mit einem ländlichen Akzent und einer Blockhütte wäre die beste Darstellung unserer Stadt.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would expect to find places to live. At least, not places that most people would want to call home. But if you venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels that are only occupied annually, except for a few summer weeks for family reunions, you'll discover an entire thriving community. Within these communities, on these streets, are several apartment complexes - arranged neatly beside each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully disassembled and lined up along the road. The first apartments you come across have been in the news for some dubious activities, so we won't delve into those too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside it, are a world apart that almost no one living in this area knows about. On the other side of those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, peaceful set of buildings standing guard beside the road, where students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to start their day. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters honk and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate accidents. The treatment center features cheerful porch furniture and a lazy ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, doing cartwheels and flip-flops across the prickly green blades while bees lazily buzz in the flower beds by the road. Senior folks walk their dogs on the walking path, glaring at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that offers affordable food but never gets too crowded - a swimming supply store next to it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and enjoying hibachi chicken, all in one stop - the charm of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop there, the DIY kind, and you often see teens in the park holding cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with toppings while they perform stunts on their skateboards and vape because they think it's cool. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where barely anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, während wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” antwortete ich, wissend, dass sie erschrecken würde über die Einsamkeit der offenen Landschaft. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte noch nie so viel offenes Land gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr von meinem Aufwachsen in ländlichem Ohio, und in diesem Moment erkannte sie, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Als wir die zweispurige Landstraße entlangfuhren, erreichten wir einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Just dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sind mostly aus Backstein und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Morgen Land, auf das sich jeder stolz pflegt. Im Frühlingszeit gibt es überall eine Fülle von jährlich gepflanzten Blumen sowie mittelhöfischen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit hochwertigen Mercedes-Benz Luxuswagen gefüllt, die nach einem guten, alten Autowasch glänzen. Weiter auf dem Weg zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines Rasenmähers gehört werden. Alle im Viertel lachen über ihn, aber er ist immer ehrlich und eine wunderbare Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit den Jahren hat er etwas von seinem Verstand verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere Zero-Turn-Mäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden.Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Moo” von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke hinweg ist ein unberührter Oase mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier habe ich meine Kindheit verbracht. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum “Jagen” von Tieren (was mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), war immer etwas zu tun und meist ein Nachbarskind zur Freundschaft bereit. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Hof verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einmal lebhafte pink, purple und orange Blumen trugen, verwandeln sich in karge Rindenstämme. Bei seltener Schneefall verwandelt sich der Winter in eine Winterwunderwelt. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneeengeln, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat, und Schneemännern gesäumt. Mein Geschwister und ich haben uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige igloidenartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, normalerweise mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Paradies spielten wir vor, in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.",
            "The first thing to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, printed on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and often toes the legal line, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a reminder of the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is now a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums for them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of things that are usually not accepted. It doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences or modern issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal too. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this a little less seriously. In my neighborhood, like many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure perfectly suited for the person wandering by, surprising the recipient often. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That's what Portland means to me, but I'm only one variety of weird among many. Some people I live among would never consider picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing their dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from (at their core) mental health problems, and the constant rain throughout much of the year, along with the overcast skies, seem to contribute. Portland also faces a homelessness problem, which seems to have no clear solution. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population oscillates between empathy and hostility. In this, Portland is not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up I am with work and life, they are there, steadfast, resolute, and untroubled by life's vicissitudes. Then, on days when I am the most stressed and frazzled, they demand to be noticed, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, day by day. I first moved here when I began my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of campus were what first captivated me. While the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also have their place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly hold sway. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés where I spent many hours fueled by caffeine and cramming. One can walk or take the bus a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an atmosphere of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town reveals its dynamism, as lively and vibrant as its neighboring urban city. This thriving energy doesn't last for many blocks, however, as one can escape once again to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderous vibe, as if it is beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Yet, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions in the middle of the night during an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have done more than once. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects live out their lives, each with some role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this enigma called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's brilliant rays shone atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during nighttime, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "Es gibt nicht viele Bürgersteige in meiner Nachbarschaft. Alles scheint bergab zu strömen, und mein Haus liegt genau am Kamm des steilsten Hügels der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Trainingshügel\", weil so viele Jogger jeden Tag daran vorbeilaufen. Da es in meiner Straße keine Bürgersteige gibt, geht jeder auf der Straße. Diese Straße ist an einigen Stellen mit Schlaglöchern übersät und kann gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Elektrokabel, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerlumpt aus. Es regnet und stürmt in unserer Gegend oft, sodass Äste und anderes Gerümpel die Stromleitungen herunterzischen und die ständigen Reparaturen sie unordentlich und bunt aussehen lassen. Es gibt viele hohe Kiefern in der Nähe, wohin man auch schaut. Aber die Menschen hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Ausblick auf den Ozean versperren. Deswegen sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit großen, verglasten zweiten Etagen, die sich nacheinander erheben, um den Ausblick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist um Sonnenuntergang herum wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten erleuchtet zu werden scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber oft bewölkt, sodass man die meiste Sonne durch Nebel sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal ließ ich meinen Wagen einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt stehen und als ich ihn uso er ausgefahren wollte, war er von Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte drei Stunden, um es alle abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nachbarschaft, obwohl sich eine Schule nur wenige Blocks entfernt befindet. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter und viele von ihnen sind pensioniert. Anstelle von Kindern haben die meisten Leute Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Vorgärten oder auf der Straße zu sehen, wie sie hintereinander herrennen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus schlüpfen. Einmal fand ich einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn zur Vordertür hinausscheuchen. Kaninchen wildern in der Gegend herum. Einige sind groß und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in den Rasenlöcher buddeln. Meine Katzen lieben sie aber und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir haben auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris und manchmal sieht man auch einen Habicht oder Adler, der von den neighborhood Krähen verscheucht wird. Es gibt keine Läden in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinabwandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants am Wasserfront, die frischen Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind lustig zum Werfen in das Wasser. Die Bucht ist nicht besonders breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste klar durch den Nebel sehen.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people who live here. Most people spend their time on yardwork and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and all that you would expect from a neighborhood. We are home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged 11 and 14. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We play outside, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue. It seems like someone is always cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there are also a lot of leaves in the Fall, which means raking and burning leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we haven't had much winter, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "Final English translation: My neighborhood is smack in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably don’t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but supposedly most places are changing the same way. Most of the time, the people are very friendly, but just like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people; I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are mostly chain stores like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want upscale, you have to travel; I never really see any Whole Foods or places of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, I would say, are based on construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there are still a lot of wide-open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's also the field my full-time job is located in, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.",
            "Wenn ich gefragt werde, wie ich meinen Wohnbezirk beschreiben soll, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigenheimbesitzer sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als den Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch den umliegenden Campus betrachte ich als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in einem geringeren Maße. Trotz dieser Eigenartigkeit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den herkömmlichen Vorstellungen von einem Wohnbezirk. So wie jeder herkömmliche Wohnbezirk hat auch mein Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich die Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk genauer betrachte, ist es am besten, die verschiedenen Hausarten zu klären, die in meiner direkten Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Umgebung: Apartments, ursprüngliche Häuser und Wohnheimhäuser. In den Apartments leben normalerweise 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume pro Stockwerk. Das gängigste Gebäude kann 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die ursprünglichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Schulbindung zur Miete erhältlich sind. Diese sind in der Regel 2-4 Schlafzimmer groß und beherbergen normalerweise Absolventen, es gibt aber nur wenige solcher Häuser im Wohnbezirk, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, in denen Hunderte von Schülern untergebracht sind. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahme weniger, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterkunft in meinem Wohnbezirk. Mit der Unterkunftsbekanntmachung sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und diese zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersklassen, die in meinem Wohnbezirk leben. Die meisten Fachkräfte leben in den Häusern, die im Wohnbezirk platziert sind, während die jüngeren Schüler in der Wohnheimunterkunft und die älteren Schüler in der Apartmentunterkunft leben. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk lassen sich nicht einfach durch ihre Beschreibung gerecht werden, daher ist es am besten, zu den Geschäften und Parks in meinem Wohnbezirk überzugehen. Da meine Schule fast vollständig autark ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte bieten eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jedem anderen Wohnbezirk finden würde, und die eigenen Marken von Schulkleidung und Lebensmitteln. So kann man in den Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks alles finden! Außerdem ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für alle vielfältigen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk, er wird von allen Bewohnern sauber gehalten und ist frei von Kriminalität!",
            "Well, since I’ve been living here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. First off, I was quite sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t lie, I cried because I missed them and I loved them, but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better neighborhood with better housing and a better high school. Everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved here. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends, and even some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived right next door. They were great people I almost considered family, and I truly appreciated them. I remember when my mom, dad, my sister, and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got re-married). It was a lot of fun and a great time, and I’m looking forward to something similar for myself someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mrs. Glen, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap from her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the flowers. We danced the whole night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since, but I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, but now that I have a GPS, I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that’s where I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and just enjoy life to the fullest that we could. Sometimes I’d go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. It gives me a sense of peace. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my wooden bokken sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time. It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try it again. My dad and my best friend used to play tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. There are many times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stand out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and I quite enjoy living here. The area is mostly apartment buildings, but there are several restaurants and bars that are fun and affordable. One of them recently changed its name and became a bit more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks remains good. Most of the residents are either college students or lower-income individuals, as the apartment housing is quite affordable. There's an elementary school within walking distance, and I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t mind. They sometimes smoke weed, so the building management put an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing. The buildings around me are quite old but might have had interior renovations. Down the street, there are newly built apartments, but I don't like them because the construction quality is poor, and the rent is expensive. Nonetheless, the area has improved with a new road and sidewalk, along with city-funded landscaping. The apartment complex I live in is surrounded by trees, which have been trimmed, leaving some stumps. Behind my complex is another tree line and a set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, and right behind is 43rd Street, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in poor condition, and many buildings look run-down. There are plenty of trees here, perhaps as a means of hiding the buildings' appearance. Crime has occurred in the apartment complex on this street, but I can't blame just them, as there are also some issues across the street from me. Despite these issues, I like living here as it is affordable, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially appreciate the university's proximity and the two bus stops, which make it easy to get to the store and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced and arranged intermittently to look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern, all-too-mechanical/computer-filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and, for the first time last night, we actually heard actual tornado sirens, so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the living room, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all over the ground. After the storm, the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, moms and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved from NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two-bedroom and two-bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of its own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town in South Carolina. It's not particularly notable, but it's significant for agriculture, especially peaches. Johnston is proudly known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" and the town proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle ranches. Houses outside the main area are spaced far apart, either with metal roofs to cool the summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road to use the front fields for animals or crops. The town center has a single stoplight at a four-way intersection, where all the stores are located. There's a small Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a burger chain, and a closed-down pizzeria. There's also a small, family-owned pharmacy famous for Cherry Coca-Cola, an expensive grocery store, and a busy Dollar General store. There's a small furniture store run by a kind woman, along with a pet grooming service. The town has a single elementary school, and for middle and high school, students must go to the next town over. There are no parks, but a recreational area is being planned. There's not much to do, but it's a pleasant, small town that you can easily miss!",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as typical cookie cutter suburbia. In particular, my neighborhood shows a strong influence from a homeowner's association. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition with no potholes. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single family homes. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "Ich lebe in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die direkt am Rand der Vororte einer Großstadt liegt. Mein direkter Wohnbezirk auf der Ostseite der Stadt könnte als die am meisten wirtschaftlich benachteiligte Gegend der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, und die majority der Häuser werden an wohnungslose oder niedrige Einkommenshaushalte vermietet oder verkauft. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind in der Regel freundliche Menschen, die mir zulächeln und „Hallo“ sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, bleibt aber insgesamt niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es einige gewalttätige Kriminalfälle in der Nähe meines Zuhauses, darunter einige Schießereien und mindestens ein Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letzten Jahr ihren Sohn bei einem Schuss vor einer Bar in der Nähe. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie bis jetzt keine direkten Auswirkungen von Kriminalität erlebt, außer dass hin und wieder mal ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir es vergessen, ins Haus zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen hat die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark unter der „Opioid-Epidemie“ gelitten, die viele Teile der USA betrifft. Viele Leben wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um gegen diese Epidemie vorzugehen, darunter mehrere Entzugsbehandlungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Betroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat die Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ausgezeichnetes Personal, von der Schulleitung bis zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er bisher keine Mobbing erlebt, und er liebt die Schule wegen der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre. Es gibt eine aktive Eltern-Lehrer-Vereinigung, die mehrere Veranstaltungen im Jahr plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den schulischen Fortschritt zu fördern. Da mehr als 20 % der Bevölkerung der Stadt unter der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlos Frühstück und Mittagessen an, sodass kein Kind hungrig nach Hause geht. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird aufgrund seiner oder ihrer Zahlungsunfähigkeit als „weniger wert“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Schulmaterialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen am Aussehen der Stadt vorgenommen, darunter das Asphaltieren von Straßen, die Landschaftsgestaltung und die Renovierung städtischer Parks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und im Westen stattgefunden, wo sich alle Einkaufsbereiche und die majority des Verkehrs befinden. Der Osten, wo ich lebe, wird vernachlässigt, was in meiner Nachbarschaft eine Quelle der Anerkennung ist. Insgesamt genieße ich das Leben in dieser Stadt. Die Leute sind in der Regel freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (Klein- und Großgeschäfte) für die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie und unser Haus mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und wir können uns keinen anderen Ort vorstellen.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a seven-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill is this cool little arcade bar that attracts different types of people, especially on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large given the part of town it is in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall stairs set into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains a lot, and the heavy rain in the mid-winter months often makes it difficult to stay warm. Setting their tents close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They are also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature—the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am dark enough to be mistaken for someone who is not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most grey and dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "Translation back to English:\nI live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there's no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Everywhere you need to go, you have to drive. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren't cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them updated and remodeled, some are older. Most homes have basements that are visible from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. There are houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and play sets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hardworking people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day, you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in good condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average-looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, there is actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single-family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes any sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now it's pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was their whole existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Einsamkeit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur 5 Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenen Raum gesehen. Verblüfft von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder erzählte ich ihr von meiner Kindheit im ländlichen Ohio, und in diesem Moment wusste sie, wer ich war und wo ich herkam. Auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße erreichen Sie eine Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt sind. Nur ein Stück dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sindmostly aus Ziegeln und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Acre Landfläche, auf die jeder stolz ist und die er pflegt. Im Frühjahr gibt es alljährlich gepflanzte Blumen und mittelmäßige Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Alle Einfahrten sind mit den teuersten Luxuswagen von Mercedes-Benz gefüllt, die in der Mittagssonne nach einem guten, altmodischen Autowasch glitzern. Während wir auf mein graues Stuckhaus zufahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und kann über das Summen seines Rasenmähers hinweg gehört werden. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer echt und eine unglaubliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat einiges von seinem Scharfsinn verloren. In der Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich oft mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere-Zero-Turn-Mähwagen. Endlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Im Hinterhof gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Muh” von den nahen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke liegt ein unberührtes Oasis, das mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen erfüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste meiner Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum “Jagen” von Tieren (das mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), war immer etwas zu tun und meist ein Nachbarskind, das ein Freund sein wollte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtende pink, lila und orange Blüten trugen, verwandeln sich in kahlen Baumstämme. Wenn der Schnee fällt, erscheint eine Winterwunderlandschaft über Nacht. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneemännern und Schneemenschen von meiner kleinen Schwester gesäumt. Sie und ich hatten uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Iglu-artige Bunker, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, oft mit Zweigen, wie eine Waffenschmiede. In unserem eigenen kleinen Winterwunderland spielten wir vor, während alles andere unwichtig war. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorge.",
            "The first thing you should understand about Portland, Oregon, is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun's journey at every dawn and dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how absorbed I am with work and life, they remain steadfast, unshaken by life's challenges. On days when I am most stressed and tense, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they help me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my studies, and the mountains to the north of campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of magnificent sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which also hold a special place in my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own way. There are countless cafés that were the home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in a sense of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line the restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much bustle and vitality as its neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks, though, as one can again escape to the peaceful small town atmosphere by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such close proximity truly gives this city a wonderful vibe, as if it is beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each tied to a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it is also home to many difficult memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have had more experience with. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some role or purpose, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The stately, imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred in me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workouts. Since there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered and worn. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines, and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around, but people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm used to most of the neighbors. People spend their time on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and recognize the cars driven around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes, and that's all you'd expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us - myself, my wife, and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. Everyone else is used to seeing us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. It seems someone is always cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October. We have many trees in our neighborhood as it was originally wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but fall brings lots of leaves, which means raking and burning them annually. I like the smell of burning leaves, so it's a nice sign that fall has arrived. We haven't had much winter lately, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is rare. I like working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked. The same happens at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people, so I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are pretty much chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want a smaller store, you have to travel; I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, according to my observations and not based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because this city is still not very developed, and there is still a lot of open space to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, this was the field my full-time job was located in; I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home are the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As I'm writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different kind of experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "Wenn man mich bitten würde, meine Nachbarschaft zu beschreiben, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einigermaßen einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer mit eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als das Collegecampus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch die umliegenden Campusbereiche betrachte ich als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in gewissermaßen geringerem Ausmaß. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat auch meine Nachbarschaft Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erforschung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner direkten Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft: die Apartments, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Erstens, in den Apartments leben normalerweise 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume pro Stockwerk. Das häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke unterbringen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens, es gibt die eigentlichen Häuser, die für alle Studenten mit einer Affiliation zur Schule zur Miete zu haben sind. Diese sind normalerweise 2-4 Schlafzimmer groß und werden oft von Absolventen bewohnt. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Reihe dieser Art von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich in der Regel 2 Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Da wir uns nun um das Wohnen gekümmert haben, sind wir bereit, uns den Menschen zuzuwenden. Mein Internat rühmt sich der Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft. Es gibt Menschen aus aller Welt und aller Altersgruppen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Die majority of the professional staff lives in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft stehen, während die neueren Studenten in den Wohnheimunterkünften und die älteren Studenten in den Apartmentunterkünften leben. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht vollständig beschrieben werden, indem man einfach über sie spricht, sodass es am besten wäre, sich den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft zuzuwenden. Da meine Schule mehr oder weniger ein eigenständiges Wohngebiet ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte bieten eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, sowie die einzigartigen Kleidungs- und Lebensmittelgeschäfte der Schule. Daher kann man alles, was man benötigt, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft finden! Darüber hinaus ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für alle die verschiedenen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Er wird von allen Bewohnern der Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten!",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that, I quite enjoy living here. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to, but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are low-income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in trees. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. The buildings are scattered and spaced in such a way that they appear as individual homes. The only difference is that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of an unplanned driveway in the evenings and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is refreshing in this modern world filled with machinery and computers. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard the actual sirens, so we had to rush to shelter. Sure enough, I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, remaining in the living room, nervous and barking about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the sudden temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun came out, and it started to rain. I ran inside and quickly snapped pictures of a double rainbow to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally returned home from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then, it was business as usual, with mothers and children outside while dinner was being prepared. This neighborhood is a gem for me, who has recently moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accent that people speak with. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is typical for the neighborhood. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy walking along the largest field behind my house and down to the pond that isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he is there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It blends in with other towns in South Carolina but has a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is famous as the Peach Capital of the World, which the town proudly displays on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main part of town are widely spaced, most are two-story with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses aren't near the road but are further back to allow the front fields for animals/crops. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three fast food places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; strangely enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There's an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, commonly known as IGA. While it's the only grocery store in the entire town, many people only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and is often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There's a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet grooming facility called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There's a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, but they are currently in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without realizing!",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single-family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. They are well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with culture. It sits atop a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and just a block down from \"The Hill,\" is a cool little arcade bar where various types of people flock to on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the part of town it's in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents close together, in the city center rather than out on the outskirts, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic architecture – the tall, proud buildings, the architecture that's scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed down from generation to generation, to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, regardless of it still being considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe this warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitter taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass as not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more readily than to rob me. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest of nights, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, you go by car. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. For anything you need, you have to drive to get to. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the image of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some being older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day, you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, there is actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single-family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes any sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now it's pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was their whole existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Einsamkeit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur 5 Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenen Raum gesehen. Verblüfft von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder erzählte ich ihr von meiner Kindheit im ländlichen Ohio, und in diesem Moment wusste sie, wer ich war und wo ich herkam. Auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße erreichen Sie eine Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt sind. Nur ein Stück dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sindmostly aus Ziegeln und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Acre Landfläche, auf die jeder stolz ist und die er pflegt. Im Frühjahr gibt es alljährlich gepflanzte Blumen und mittelmäßige Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Alle Einfahrten sind mit den teuersten Luxuswagen von Mercedes-Benz gefüllt, die in der Mittagssonne nach einem guten, altmodischen Autowasch glitzern. Während wir auf mein graues Stuckhaus zufahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und kann über das Summen seines Rasenmähers hinweg gehört werden. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer echt und eine unglaubliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat einiges von seinem Scharfsinn verloren. In der Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich oft mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere-Zero-Turn-Mähwagen. Endlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Im Hinterhof gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Muh” von den nahen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke liegt ein unberührtes Oasis, das mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen erfüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste meiner Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum “Jagen” von Tieren (das mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), war immer etwas zu tun und meist ein Nachbarskind, das ein Freund sein wollte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtende pink, lila und orange Blüten trugen, verwandeln sich in kahlen Baumstämme. Wenn der Schnee fällt, erscheint eine Winterwunderlandschaft über Nacht. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneemännern und Schneemenschen von meiner kleinen Schwester gesäumt. Sie und ich hatten uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Iglu-artige Bunker, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, oft mit Zweigen, wie eine Waffenschmiede. In unserem eigenen kleinen Winterwunderland spielten wir vor, während alles andere unwichtig war. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorge.",
            "The first thing you should understand about Portland, Oregon, is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun's journey at every dawn and dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how absorbed I am with work and life, they remain steadfast, unshaken by life's challenges. On days when I am most stressed and tense, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they help me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my studies, and the mountains to the north of campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of magnificent sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which also hold a special place in my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own way. There are countless cafés that were the home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in a sense of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line the restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much bustle and vitality as its neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks, though, as one can again escape to the peaceful small town atmosphere by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such close proximity truly gives this city a wonderful vibe, as if it is beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each tied to a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it is also home to many difficult memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have had more experience with. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some role or purpose, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The stately, imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred in me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workouts. Since there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered and worn. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines, and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around, but people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm used to most of the neighbors. People spend their time on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and recognize the cars driven around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes, and that's all you'd expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us - myself, my wife, and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. Everyone else is used to seeing us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. It seems someone is always cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October. We have many trees in our neighborhood as it was originally wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but fall brings lots of leaves, which means raking and burning them annually. I like the smell of burning leaves, so it's a nice sign that fall has arrived. We haven't had much winter lately, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is rare. I like working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked. The same happens at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people, so I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are pretty much chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want a smaller store, you have to travel; I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, according to my observations and not based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because this city is still not very developed, and there is still a lot of open space to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, this was the field my full-time job was located in; I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home are the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As I'm writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different kind of experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "Wenn man mich bitten würde, meine Nachbarschaft zu beschreiben, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einigermaßen einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer mit eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als das Collegecampus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch die umliegenden Campusbereiche betrachte ich als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in gewissermaßen geringerem Ausmaß. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat auch meine Nachbarschaft Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erforschung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner direkten Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft: die Apartments, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Erstens, in den Apartments leben normalerweise 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume pro Stockwerk. Das häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke unterbringen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens, es gibt die eigentlichen Häuser, die für alle Studenten mit einer Affiliation zur Schule zur Miete zu haben sind. Diese sind normalerweise 2-4 Schlafzimmer groß und werden oft von Absolventen bewohnt. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Reihe dieser Art von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich in der Regel 2 Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Da wir uns nun um das Wohnen gekümmert haben, sind wir bereit, uns den Menschen zuzuwenden. Mein Internat rühmt sich der Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft. Es gibt Menschen aus aller Welt und aller Altersgruppen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Die majority of the professional staff lives in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft stehen, während die neueren Studenten in den Wohnheimunterkünften und die älteren Studenten in den Apartmentunterkünften leben. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht vollständig beschrieben werden, indem man einfach über sie spricht, sodass es am besten wäre, sich den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft zuzuwenden. Da meine Schule mehr oder weniger ein eigenständiges Wohngebiet ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte bieten eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, sowie die einzigartigen Kleidungs- und Lebensmittelgeschäfte der Schule. Daher kann man alles, was man benötigt, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft finden! Darüber hinaus ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für alle die verschiedenen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Er wird von allen Bewohnern der Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten!",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that, I quite enjoy living here. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to, but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are low-income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in trees. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. The buildings are scattered and spaced in such a way that they appear as individual homes. The only difference is that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of an unplanned driveway in the evenings and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is refreshing in this modern world filled with machinery and computers. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard the actual sirens, so we had to rush to shelter. Sure enough, I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, remaining in the living room, nervous and barking about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the sudden temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun came out, and it started to rain. I ran inside and quickly snapped pictures of a double rainbow to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally returned home from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then, it was business as usual, with mothers and children outside while dinner was being prepared. This neighborhood is a gem for me, who has recently moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accent that people speak with. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is typical for the neighborhood. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy walking along the largest field behind my house and down to the pond that isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he is there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It blends in with other towns in South Carolina but has a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is famous as the Peach Capital of the World, which the town proudly displays on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main part of town are widely spaced, most are two-story with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses aren't near the road but are further back to allow the front fields for animals/crops. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three fast food places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; strangely enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There's an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, commonly known as IGA. While it's the only grocery store in the entire town, many people only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and is often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There's a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet grooming facility called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There's a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, but they are currently in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without realizing!",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single-family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. They are well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with culture. It sits atop a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and just a block down from \"The Hill,\" is a cool little arcade bar where various types of people flock to on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the part of town it's in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents close together, in the city center rather than out on the outskirts, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic architecture – the tall, proud buildings, the architecture that's scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed down from generation to generation, to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, regardless of it still being considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe this warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitter taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass as not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more readily than to rob me. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest of nights, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, you go by car. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. For anything you need, you have to drive to get to. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the image of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some being older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day, you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, there is actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single-family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes any sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now it's pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was their whole existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called Super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Einsamkeit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur 5 Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenen Raum gesehen. Verblüfft von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder erzählte ich ihr von meiner Kindheit im ländlichen Ohio, und in diesem Moment wusste sie, wer ich war und wo ich herkam. Auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße erreichen Sie eine Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt sind. Nur ein Stück dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sindmostly aus Ziegeln und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Acre Landfläche, auf die jeder stolz ist und die er pflegt. Im Frühjahr gibt es alljährlich gepflanzte Blumen und mittelmäßige Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Alle Einfahrten sind mit den teuersten Luxuswagen von Mercedes-Benz gefüllt, die in der Mittagssonne nach einem guten, altmodischen Autowasch glitzern. Während wir auf mein graues Stuckhaus zufahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und kann über das Summen seines Rasenmähers hinweg gehört werden. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer echt und eine unglaubliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat einiges von seinem Scharfsinn verloren. In der Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich oft mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere-Zero-Turn-Mähwagen. Endlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Im Hinterhof gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Muh” von den nahen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke liegt ein unberührtes Oasis, das mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen erfüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste meiner Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum “Jagen” von Tieren (das mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), war immer etwas zu tun und meist ein Nachbarskind, das ein Freund sein wollte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtende pink, lila und orange Blüten trugen, verwandeln sich in kahlen Baumstämme. Wenn der Schnee fällt, erscheint eine Winterwunderlandschaft über Nacht. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneemännern und Schneemenschen von meiner kleinen Schwester gesäumt. Sie und ich hatten uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Iglu-artige Bunker, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, oft mit Zweigen, wie eine Waffenschmiede. In unserem eigenen kleinen Winterwunderland spielten wir vor, während alles andere unwichtig war. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorge.",
            "The first thing you should understand about Portland, Oregon, is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun's journey at every dawn and dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how absorbed I am with work and life, they remain steadfast, unshaken by life's challenges. On days when I am most stressed and tense, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they help me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to carry on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my studies, and the mountains to the north of campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of magnificent sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which also hold a special place in my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own way. There are countless cafés that were the home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in a sense of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line the restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much bustle and vitality as its neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks, though, as one can again escape to the peaceful small town atmosphere by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such close proximity truly gives this city a wonderful vibe, as if it is beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each tied to a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it is also home to many difficult memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have had more experience with. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some role or purpose, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The stately, imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, they stirred in me a sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workouts. Since there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered and worn. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines, and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork. There are many tall evergreen trees all around, but people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm used to most of the neighbors. People spend their time on yard work and daily chores. In winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. Our house is at the front corner of the street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and recognize the cars driven around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we take note. Some neighbors go for walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes, and that's all you'd expect. We are home a lot because we work from our house. There are four of us - myself, my wife, and two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. Everyone else is used to seeing us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. Occasionally, we grill outside on our back deck, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. It seems someone is always cutting grass around here, and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through October. We have many trees in our neighborhood as it was originally wooded, so there's plenty of shade, but fall brings lots of leaves, which means raking and burning them annually. I like the smell of burning leaves, so it's a nice sign that fall has arrived. We haven't had much winter lately, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which is rare. I like working in the garage on my truck or other projects, and when the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town, and there are extra cars parked. The same happens at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people, so I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are pretty much chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want a smaller store, you have to travel; I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, according to my observations and not based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because this city is still not very developed, and there is still a lot of open space to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, this was the field my full-time job was located in; I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home are the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As I'm writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different kind of experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "Wenn man mich bitten würde, meine Nachbarschaft zu beschreiben, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einigermaßen einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer mit eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als das Collegecampus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch die umliegenden Campusbereiche betrachte ich als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in gewissermaßen geringerem Ausmaß. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat auch meine Nachbarschaft Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erforschung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner direkten Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft: die Apartments, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Erstens, in den Apartments leben normalerweise 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume pro Stockwerk. Das häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke unterbringen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens, es gibt die eigentlichen Häuser, die für alle Studenten mit einer Affiliation zur Schule zur Miete zu haben sind. Diese sind normalerweise 2-4 Schlafzimmer groß und werden oft von Absolventen bewohnt. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Reihe dieser Art von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich in der Regel 2 Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Da wir uns nun um das Wohnen gekümmert haben, sind wir bereit, uns den Menschen zuzuwenden. Mein Internat rühmt sich der Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft. Es gibt Menschen aus aller Welt und aller Altersgruppen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Die majority of the professional staff lives in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft stehen, während die neueren Studenten in den Wohnheimunterkünften und die älteren Studenten in den Apartmentunterkünften leben. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht vollständig beschrieben werden, indem man einfach über sie spricht, sodass es am besten wäre, sich den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft zuzuwenden. Da meine Schule mehr oder weniger ein eigenständiges Wohngebiet ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte bieten eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, sowie die einzigartigen Kleidungs- und Lebensmittelgeschäfte der Schule. Daher kann man alles, was man benötigt, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft finden! Darüber hinaus ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für alle die verschiedenen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Er wird von allen Bewohnern der Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten!",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that, I quite enjoy living here. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to, but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are low-income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in trees. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. The buildings are scattered and spaced in such a way that they appear as individual homes. The only difference is that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of an unplanned driveway in the evenings and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is refreshing in this modern world filled with machinery and computers. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard the actual sirens, so we had to rush to shelter. Sure enough, I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, remaining in the living room, nervous and barking about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the sudden temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun came out, and it started to rain. I ran inside and quickly snapped pictures of a double rainbow to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally returned home from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then, it was business as usual, with mothers and children outside while dinner was being prepared. This neighborhood is a gem for me, who has recently moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accent that people speak with. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is typical for the neighborhood. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I enjoy walking along the largest field behind my house and down to the pond that isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer there, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he is there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It blends in with other towns in South Carolina but has a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is famous as the Peach Capital of the World, which the town proudly displays on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland, either filled with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside the main part of town are widely spaced, most are two-story with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses aren't near the road but are further back to allow the front fields for animals/crops. In the main part of town, there's a single stop sign at a four-way intersection where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three fast food places: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; strangely enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There's an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, commonly known as IGA. While it's the only grocery store in the entire town, many people only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and is often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There's a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet grooming facility called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There's a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, but they are currently in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without realizing!",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single-family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. They are well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with culture. It sits atop a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and just a block down from \"The Hill,\" is a cool little arcade bar where various types of people flock to on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the part of town it's in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents close together, in the city center rather than out on the outskirts, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic architecture – the tall, proud buildings, the architecture that's scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed down from generation to generation, to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, regardless of it still being considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe this warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitter taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass as not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more readily than to rob me. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest of nights, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, you go by car. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. For anything you need, you have to drive to get to. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the image of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some being older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day, you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Da ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Viertel extrem vielfältig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen Geschäftsarealen verstreut, wo eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben wird. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsstätten sind. Es fehlt an neuen Restaurants zum Essen oder Läden zum Einkaufen. Während einige Läden große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, sind kleine Boutiquen ebenfalls sehr beliebt. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern auch in den Straßen, die oft in Gehweite von Wohnvierteln liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn nicht so viele interessante Punkte in der Nähe wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen betrifft, gibt es in meinem Viertel eine bemerkenswerte Vielfalt. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, die jedoch oft in eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt leben. Es gibt Orte wie Korea Town, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch bereits ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein, besonders bei Stau, besonders in der Rushhour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt läuft überall hin, obwohl einige interessante Punkte in der Nähe sind. Die Stadt ist riesig, und die meisten Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Daher haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall einen Parkplatz zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren viel Bauaktivität, da große Wohnblöcke in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebter Ort zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht über die Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen und mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt verschiedene Hausarten. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Apartments und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, andere Duplexe. Dies ist auch innerhalb meines direkten Viertels der Fall, sodass es auch keine Mangel an Wohnungsoptionen gibt. Ähnlich ist das Viertel aus Menschen verschiedenen Alters zusammengesetzt, und ehrlich gesagt kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft, wie ich viele Kindheitserinnerungen habe, in denen ich mit meinem direkten Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Nachbarn aus dem Viertel, die alle in meinem Alter waren, draußen gespielt habe.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but some have been split into two, still attached, if that makes sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this country, but now it's pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was their whole existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called \"Super A\", owned by a large Yemeni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to let cars pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not the kind of place one would expect to find living quarters. At least, not the kind of living quarters that most people would want to live in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and continue past the hotels which are only occupied annually except for a few summer seasons for family reunions, you'll discover an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, you'll find a few apartment complexes placed carefully next to each other, like Russian nesting dolls that have been meticulously taken apart and set side by side in a line down the road. The first apartments you encounter are those that have made the news for some rather unsavory dealings, so we won't dwell on those too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside it, are a different story that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students trickle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for causing traffic jams on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with unfortunate bone breaks on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily rotating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, performing cartwheels and somersaults across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches by the road. Elderly residents walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely to the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a shopping mall beside the park that offers inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the convenience of a shopping mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the quiet south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Kargheit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie war aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenes Gelände gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Häufigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich stammte. Wenn man auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße fährt, erreicht man eine Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt sind. Jenseits davon befindet sich die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen mostly aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens eine halbe Akre Land für sich selbst, um die sich alle kümmern. Im Frühling blühen die alljährlich gepflanzten Blumen, und die mittlere Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit Luxus-Mercedes-Benz-Luxusautos gefüllt, die nach einer gründlichen Waschstraße im Mittagslicht glänzen. Während wir auf mein graues Stuckhaus zufahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines John Deere Zero-Turn-Mähers gehört werden. Jeder im Viertel freut sich über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine wunderbare Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit dem Alter hat er etwas von seinem Witz verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und passt sich mit der Wiese und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mähgerät.",
            "Der erste Punkt, den du über Portland, Oregon verstehen musst, ist der Begriff \"weird\". Das unoffizielle Stadtslogan, auf dem Rücken eines Gebäudes, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musik venue, Stripclub und das Gesetz in mindestens der Hälfte dieser Tätigkeiten umgehen dient, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist dies ein kleiner Aufruf, sich das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er vor Augen zu halten, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Undergroundkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es eine lockende Einladung - komm nach Portland, wo die Menschen dich immer noch als \"weird\" bezeichnen, aber dieses Mal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und dem ständigen Bau von Wohnungen für diese, sind die Baupläne weiterhin \"weird\". \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht, dass wir nicht über moderne Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe verfügen. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge in China. Es gibt Millionen von Weisen, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat mehr als genug Normalität. Portland hat Yoga und Hipster und Geschäftsprofis. Vielleicht bedeutet \"weird\", dass wir einfach alles nicht so ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Nachbarschaften, gibt es bunte Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen und Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straße säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Kostenlose Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die jemanden enthält, der sich von etwas trennt, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, einen Schatz, der perfekt für den Vorbeigehenden ist, oft. Diese Kisten enthalten normalerweise Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das Magische am Durchwandern einer Südostportland-Nachbarschaft ist genau das, was Portland bedeutet. Das ist, was Portland für mich bedeutet, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden Arten von \"weird\". Einige Menschen, unter denen ich lebe, würden sich nie ihre Kleidung aus Kisten auf dem Bürgersteig aussuchen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Ziegengymnastik (ja, Gymnastik mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Spielen der Timbers (der Stadtfußballverein). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihren Träumen nachjagen oder davon träumen, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme sind (in ihrer Ursache) oft psychische Gesundheitsprobleme, und der ständige Regen durch den größten Teil des Jahres, plus die trüben Wolken, scheinen ein Beitrag zu sein. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosigkeitsproblem, mit dem niemand weiß, was zu tun ist. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird von den sozialen Dienstleistungen angelockt, die Portland besser bietet als die meisten anderen Teile des Landes, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind, wie in allen Teilen des Landes, unzureichend. Die nicht-obdachlosen Menschen sind zwischen Fürsorge und Hass gespalten. In diesem Punkt sind wir gar nicht \"weird\".",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or get caught up in work and life, they are there, steadfast, unopposing, and undisturbed by life's difficulties. On days when I am the most stressed and worn out, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, giving me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which have their own place in my heart, but it is the mountains that hold the throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that have been home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much bustle and vigor as its neighboring urban city. However, this doesn't last for many blocks, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderful vibe, as if it is inviting you to explore. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "Falls Bensonhurst in Brooklyn auf Ihrer Besuchsplanung steht, werden Sie es nicht schwer finden! Die öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung ist sehr gut und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsarten in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, so fühlen Sie sich weiterhin, als ob Sie in New York City wären. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich auf die vielen asiatischen Geschäfte vorbereiten, die um Sie herum sind. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst eine Welle von asiatischen Einwohnern erlebt. Daher sehen Sie auf Ihrem Spaziergang mindestens ein asiatisch geführtes Geschäft pro Block. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Diese Unternehmen sind bei den lokalen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. In meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die nur zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Das Adds nur zur Bequemlichkeit des Einkaufs. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, aber es ist sehr vielseitig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten und zweiten Generation amerikanischen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Nähe sind von Asiatischen Unternehmen geführt. Neben den asiatischen Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe mit etwa zehn Basketballplätzen, einem großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätzen, Schaukeln, einem Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einer Wasserfontäne für Kinder, um im Sommer Wasser zu genießen. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielseitig. Sie werden viele Arten von Vielfalt sehen, wo man spielen und gut zusammenarbeiten kann. In diesem Stadtteil gibt es nicht viele große Unternehmensgebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind für das kooperative Wohnen oder für Eigentumswohnungen. Der Großteil der Wohnräume sind Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren oder ständig Gas geben, was Sie morgens früh weckt. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie vorsichtig sein. Dieser Stadtteil ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie könnten auf Menschen treffen, die aus heiterem Himmel Trouble machen, Rowdies und Diebe. Auch ich wurde in diesem Stadtteil in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das ist schon viele Jahre her. Ein jüngster Vorfall betraf das Stehlen von Paketen. Obwohl es hiergangbliche sind, gibt es auch Paketdiebe in diesem Stadtteil. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Gebühr für Menschen erhebt, die ihren Hund nicht aufräumen, befolgen die Menschen hier die Regeln nicht. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn-Station oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größtes Ärgernis sind Hundehaufen überall, wo ich in diesem Stadtteil hingehe. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!",
            "In der Gegend, in der ich lebe, gibt es nicht viele Gehwege. Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt direkt an der Spitze des steilsten Hügels im Viertel. Die Leute nennen es den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Läufer gerne daran entlang joggen, um ihre täglichen Arbeitssitzungen durchzuführen. Da es auf meiner Straße keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen voller Schlaglöcher und kann ein wenig gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block verlaufen, sehen zerschlissen aus. Bei uns regnet und stürmt es oft, daher bekommen die Stromleitungen häufig von Ästen und anderen Schmutzpartikeln getroffen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussehen, als ob sie mit Flicken überzogen wären. Überall, wohin man auch schaut, gibt es hohe Nadelbäume. Die Einheimischen hassen diese Bäume, weil sie die Sicht auf den Ozean versperren. Daher sind viele Häuser auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen gläsernen zweiten Stockwerken, die sich an der Bucht erheben. Es ist wunderschön am Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird, aber es ist oft bewölkt, so dass man die Sonne durch eine Dunstschicht sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal habe ich mein Auto einen Monat lang im Driveway stehen lassen und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig geworden. Es hat drei Stunden gedauert, das Moos abzu kratzen. In meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es nicht viele Kinder, aber es gibt eine Schule nur ein paar Blocks entfernt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter und viele von ihnen sind im Ruhestand. Statt Kinder haben die meisten Menschen Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Gärten oder die Straße entlang rennen zu sehen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus eindringen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn durch die Vordertür hinausscheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige sind gut gebaut, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasen der Menschen graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten aus der Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und manchmal schwebt ein Habicht oder ein Adler vorbei, bis die Nachbarschaftskrähen ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man ein paar Blocks bergab zum Wasser geht, gibt es einige Restaurants, die frischen Seefisch servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind Spaß, wenn man Steine ins Wasser wirft. Die Bucht ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste auch durch den Nebel hindurch klar sehen.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but supposedly most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people, I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want to shop, you have to travel. I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, I would say, not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is because this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's also where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and that are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.",
            "Wenn man mich nach meiner Nachbarschaft fragt, ist meine Antwort sicherlich etwas einzigartig. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit ihrem eigenen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als den Campus, auf dem ich lebe, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte den umliegenden Campus auch als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Eigenartigkeit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den üblichen Vorstellungen von einem Wohnbezirk. Genauso wie jeder übliche Wohnbezirk, hat auch mein Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich die Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk erkunde, ist es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Umgebung: Wohnungen, Wohnhäuser und Wohnheimräume. Zunächst gibt es in den Wohnungen normalerweise 2-4 Personen in jedem Zimmer und etwa 4-6 Zimmer pro Stockwerk. Die häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule gemietet werden können. Diese sind normalerweise 2-4-Zimmer-Setups und werden oft von Absolventen bewohnt. Es gibt jedoch nur einige wenige solcher Häuser, die in den Wohnbezirk verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimräume, in denen Hunderte von Studenten leben. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art von Wohnraum in meinem Wohnbezirk. Nachdem wir das Wohnen behandelt haben, sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule legt großen Wert auf Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es leben Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen in meinem Wohnbezirk. Die meisten Angestellten leben in den Häusern im Wohnbezirk, während die jüngeren Studenten in den Wohnheimen leben und die älteren in der Wohnungsbauart. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk können nicht gerecht werden, indem man einfach darüber spricht, also ist es am besten, zu den Geschäften und Parks in meinem Wohnbezirk überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich ein eigenes, in sich geschlossenes Wohnviertel ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensoptionen, die man in jedem anderen Wohnbezirk finden würde, und die eigenen Marken von Kleidung und Lebensmitteln der Schule. Daher kann man alles innerhalb der Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks finden! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für alle die verschiedenen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk, er wird sauber und kriminell frei gehalten von allen Mitgliedern meines Wohnbezirks!",
            "Well, as I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was quite sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won't lie, I cried, because I missed them and loved them. But my parents and I wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They were enjoyable people that I almost consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, my mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married). It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that is when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd always have a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college that I attend, and I really enjoy living there. Mostly, there are apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and not too expensive. One of the bars was just renamed, and it is more expensive, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have a lower income, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, and I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It's almost offensive. The buildings around me are usually old-looking but might have been renovated. A bit down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them because I think the construction on them wasn't particularly good. They are cheaply built, but the rent is expensive, which I think is a rip-off, but because they are near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There's a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look rundown. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced out in a way that makes them look like individual houses, with the exception that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone here is friendly with each other. We often gather at the end of the street some evenings to chat while the neighborhood's children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly kites. It's very refreshing in this modern, tech-filled world. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white clouds. The only downside? This season, we're having tornado warnings, and last night we heard the actual tornado sirens, so we had to head to shelter. I was in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My larger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop, from 92°F to 75°F in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. Looking up, I saw the sun break through and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and took pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual, with moms and children outside while dinner was cooked. This is a friendly neighborhood for me, who recently moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors, though not all the interiors are the same. Some apartments are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I love walking along the biggest field behind my house to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer here, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters from the surrounding farms. It feels like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories are still here. The same people who lived here when I first moved are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. There are a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never had a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It stands out little from any other in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" which the town proudly displays on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland dominated by peach trees or cattle. Houses not located in the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are not near the road, but further back, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is a single stop light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; strangely enough, they are best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without realizing!",
            "Das erste Mal, als ich von meinem Wohnort hörte, hörte ich ein Podcast über verschwundene Menschen. Es war ein bisschen überraschend. Fast jede Wohnung im Bereich ging für über tausend Dollar pro Monat. Ich hatte noch nie etwas davon gehört, und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht ist es der Kampf. Ich weiß, dass einige meiner Freunde sich nachts in den Schlaf weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Du gewöhntest dich an den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarktspielzeugen und muffiger Kleidung. Du riechst weniger im Erwachsenenalter. Du könntest rauchen oder du könntest einfach zu gewohnt an den Dingen sein. Aber der Flohmarkt drängt sich immer auf. Der Geruch des Erwachsenwerdens ist staubige Magazine, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er sitzt sich in das Leder und bleibt selbst nach dem Waschen. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden in Gehweite. Wenn du auf der anderen Seite beginnst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeitssecond-Hand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen Seltenbuchladen und einen Kuriositätenladen aufsuchen. Downtown ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du würdest es in den Second-Hand-Läden nicht hören. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr gibt es immer mehr von denen. Autos und Menschen strömen herein. Es ist eine sich entwickelnde Stadt, heißt es. Mit Hauptsitz eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung, zeigt es noch wachsende Schmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder ist auf seine eigenen Ziele gerichtet, und niemand fragt wirklich nach dir. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein, und die Stadt lässt dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo Sorge bedeutet, dass man sich kümmert. Man bohrt hier nicht in das Leben der Menschen ein. Du kannst deine Schale so lange tragen, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt rollt und rollt wie Wellen am Strand. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort zu sein. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den beiden Amateurstimmen oben ist immer etwas los. Auf eine Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir versammeln uns für unsere Bedürfnisse, feiern Geburtstage, trauern bei Beerdigungen und helfen einander, wo wir können. Auf eine Weise bin ich froh, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich gut. Ich versuche, dafür zu sorgen, dass ich nach mir selbst reinige und ihnen Essen zurücklasse und sie tun das gleiche für mich. Ich bringe Post zu ihnen und sie zu mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gegenwart so sehr wie ich ihre. Ich lebe in einer riesigen, entmenschlichenden modernen Ausbreitung, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht total ruiniert habe.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as typical cookie cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Occasionally, you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood, you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. They are well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. Regarding the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, is the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly and will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in our town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive attributes. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced bullying so far, thanks to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, so the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial difficulties, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the center of town and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "The neighborhood I live in is full of culture. It is situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. My apartment building, which is seven stories tall, is located directly across from the old live theater, and just a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there is a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the area it's in. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months make it difficult to stay warm. They set their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the wilderness, to keep them warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historical sites - the tall, proud buildings and the architecture that sprawls across the varying levels of the hills rolling down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA sweeping through to clean the streets are still told. The people haven't forgotten. Stories are passed down from generation to generation, including to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, even though it is still considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most dreary nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "**\n\nI live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You have to drive to get anywhere. Despite this, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Da ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Viertel extrem vielfältig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen Geschäftsarealen verstreut, wo eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben wird. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsstätten sind. Es fehlt an neuen Restaurants zum Essen oder Läden zum Einkaufen. Während einige Läden große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, sind kleine Boutiquen ebenfalls sehr beliebt. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern auch in den Straßen, die oft in Gehweite von Wohnvierteln liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn nicht so viele interessante Punkte in der Nähe wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen betrifft, gibt es in meinem Viertel eine bemerkenswerte Vielfalt. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, die jedoch oft in eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt leben. Es gibt Orte wie Korea Town, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch bereits ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein, besonders bei Stau, besonders in der Rushhour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt läuft überall hin, obwohl einige interessante Punkte in der Nähe sind. Die Stadt ist riesig, und die meisten Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Daher haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall einen Parkplatz zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren viel Bauaktivität, da große Wohnblöcke in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebter Ort zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht über die Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen und mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt verschiedene Hausarten. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Apartments und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, andere Duplexe. Dies ist auch innerhalb meines direkten Viertels der Fall, sodass es auch keine Mangel an Wohnungsoptionen gibt. Ähnlich ist das Viertel aus Menschen verschiedenen Alters zusammengesetzt, und ehrlich gesagt kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft, wie ich viele Kindheitserinnerungen habe, in denen ich mit meinem direkten Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Nachbarn aus dem Viertel, die alle in meinem Alter waren, draußen gespielt habe.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but some have been split into two, still attached, if that makes sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this country, but now it's pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was their whole existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called \"Super A\", owned by a large Yemeni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to let cars pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not the kind of place one would expect to find living quarters. At least, not the kind of living quarters that most people would want to live in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and continue past the hotels which are only occupied annually except for a few summer seasons for family reunions, you'll discover an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, you'll find a few apartment complexes placed carefully next to each other, like Russian nesting dolls that have been meticulously taken apart and set side by side in a line down the road. The first apartments you encounter are those that have made the news for some rather unsavory dealings, so we won't dwell on those too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside it, are a different story that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students trickle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for causing traffic jams on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with unfortunate bone breaks on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily rotating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, performing cartwheels and somersaults across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches by the road. Elderly residents walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely to the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a shopping mall beside the park that offers inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the convenience of a shopping mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the quiet south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Kargheit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie war aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenes Gelände gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Häufigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich stammte. Wenn man auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße fährt, erreicht man eine Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt sind. Jenseits davon befindet sich die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen mostly aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens eine halbe Akre Land für sich selbst, um die sich alle kümmern. Im Frühling blühen die alljährlich gepflanzten Blumen, und die mittlere Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit Luxus-Mercedes-Benz-Luxusautos gefüllt, die nach einer gründlichen Waschstraße im Mittagslicht glänzen. Während wir auf mein graues Stuckhaus zufahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines John Deere Zero-Turn-Mähers gehört werden. Jeder im Viertel freut sich über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine wunderbare Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit dem Alter hat er etwas von seinem Witz verloren.

            "Der erste Punkt, den du über Portland, Oregon verstehen musst, ist der Begriff \"weird\". Das unoffizielle Stadtslogan, auf dem Rücken eines Gebäudes, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musik venue, Stripclub und das Gesetz in mindestens der Hälfte dieser Tätigkeiten umgehen dient, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist dies ein kleiner Aufruf, sich das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er vor Augen zu halten, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Undergroundkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es eine lockende Einladung - komm nach Portland, wo die Menschen dich immer noch als \"weird\" bezeichnen, aber dieses Mal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und dem ständigen Bau von Wohnungen für diese, sind die Baupläne weiterhin \"weird\". \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht, dass wir nicht über moderne Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe verfügen. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge in China. Es gibt Millionen von Weisen, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat mehr als genug Normalität. Portland hat Yoga und Hipster und Geschäftsprofis. Vielleicht bedeutet \"weird\", dass wir einfach alles nicht so ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Nachbarschaften, gibt es bunte Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen und Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straße säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Kostenlose Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die jemanden enthält, der sich von etwas trennt, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, einen Schatz, der perfekt für den Vorbeigehenden ist, oft. Diese Kisten enthalten normalerweise Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das Magische am Durchwandern einer Südostportland-Nachbarschaft ist genau das, was Portland bedeutet. Das ist, was Portland für mich bedeutet, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden Arten von \"weird\". Einige Menschen, unter denen ich lebe, würden sich nie ihre Kleidung aus Kisten auf dem Bürgersteig aussuchen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Ziegengymnastik (ja, Gymnastik mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Spielen der Timbers (der Stadtfußballverein). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihren Träumen nachjagen oder davon träumen, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme sind (in ihrer Ursache) oft psychische Gesundheitsprobleme, und der ständige Regen durch den größten Teil des Jahres, plus die trüben Wolken, scheinen ein Beitrag zu sein. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosigkeitsproblem, mit dem niemand weiß, was zu tun ist. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird von den sozialen Dienstleistungen angelockt, die Portland besser bietet als die meisten anderen Teile des Landes, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind, wie in allen Teilen des Landes, unzureichend. Die nicht-obdachlosen Menschen sind zwischen Fürsorge und Hass gespalten. In diesem Punkt sind wir gar nicht \"weird\".",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or get caught up in work and life, they are there, steadfast, unopposing, and undisturbed by life's difficulties. On days when I am the most stressed and worn out, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, giving me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which have their own place in my heart, but it is the mountains that hold the throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that have been home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much bustle and vigor as its neighboring urban city. However, this doesn't last for many blocks, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderful vibe, as if it is inviting you to explore. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "Falls Bensonhurst in Brooklyn auf Ihrer Besuchsplanung steht, werden Sie es nicht schwer finden! Die öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung ist sehr gut und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsarten in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, so fühlen Sie sich weiterhin, als ob Sie in New York City wären. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich auf die vielen asiatischen Geschäfte vorbereiten, die um Sie herum sind. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst eine Welle von asiatischen Einwohnern erlebt. Daher sehen Sie auf Ihrem Spaziergang mindestens ein asiatisch geführtes Geschäft pro Block. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Diese Unternehmen sind bei den lokalen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. In meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die nur zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Das Adds nur zur Bequemlichkeit des Einkaufs. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, aber es ist sehr vielseitig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten und zweiten Generation amerikanischen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Nähe sind von Asiatischen Unternehmen geführt. Neben den asiatischen Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe mit etwa zehn Basketballplätzen, einem großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätzen, Schaukeln, einem Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einer Wasserfontäne für Kinder, um im Sommer Wasser zu genießen. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielseitig. Sie werden viele Arten von Vielfalt sehen, wo man spielen und gut zusammenarbeiten kann. In diesem Stadtteil gibt es nicht viele große Unternehmensgebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind für das kooperative Wohnen oder für Eigentumswohnungen. Der Großteil der Wohnräume sind Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren oder ständig Gas geben, was Sie morgens früh weckt. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie vorsichtig sein. Dieser Stadtteil ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie könnten auf Menschen treffen, die aus heiterem Himmel Trouble machen, Rowdies und Diebe. Auch ich wurde in diesem Stadtteil in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das ist schon viele Jahre her. Ein jüngster Vorfall betraf das Stehlen von Paketen. Obwohl es hiergangbliche sind, gibt es auch Paketdiebe in diesem Stadtteil. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Gebühr für Menschen erhebt, die ihren Hund nicht aufräumen, befolgen die Menschen hier die Regeln nicht. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn-Station oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größtes Ärgernis sind Hundehaufen überall, wo ich in diesem Stadtteil hingehe. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!",
            "In der Gegend, in der ich lebe, gibt es nicht viele Gehwege. Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt direkt an der Spitze des steilsten Hügels im Viertel. Die Leute nennen es den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Läufer gerne daran entlang joggen, um ihre täglichen Arbeitssitzungen durchzuführen. Da es auf meiner Straße keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen voller Schlaglöcher und kann ein wenig gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block verlaufen, sehen zerschlissen aus. Bei uns regnet und stürmt es oft, daher bekommen die Stromleitungen häufig von Ästen und anderen Schmutzpartikeln getroffen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussehen, als ob sie mit Flicken überzogen wären. Überall, wohin man auch schaut, gibt es hohe Nadelbäume. Die Einheimischen hassen diese Bäume, weil sie die Sicht auf den Ozean versperren. Daher sind viele Häuser auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen gläsernen zweiten Stockwerken, die sich an der Bucht erheben. Es ist wunderschön am Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird, aber es ist oft bewölkt, so dass man die Sonne durch eine Dunstschicht sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal habe ich mein Auto einen Monat lang im Driveway stehen lassen und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig geworden. Es hat drei Stunden gedauert, das Moos abzu kratzen. In meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es nicht viele Kinder, aber es gibt eine Schule nur ein paar Blocks entfernt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter und viele von ihnen sind im Ruhestand. Statt Kinder haben die meisten Menschen Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Gärten oder die Straße entlang rennen zu sehen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus eindringen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn durch die Vordertür hinausscheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige sind gut gebaut, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasen der Menschen graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten aus der Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und manchmal schwebt ein Habicht oder ein Adler vorbei, bis die Nachbarschaftskrähen ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man ein paar Blocks bergab zum Wasser geht, gibt es einige Restaurants, die frischen Seefisch servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind Spaß, wenn man Steine ins Wasser wirft. Die Bucht ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste auch durch den Nebel hindurch klar sehen.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but supposedly most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people, I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want to shop, you have to travel. I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, I would say, not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is because this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's also where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and that are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.",
            "Wenn man mich nach meiner Nachbarschaft fragt, ist meine Antwort sicherlich etwas einzigartig. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit ihrem eigenen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als den Campus, auf dem ich lebe, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte den umliegenden Campus auch als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Eigenartigkeit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den üblichen Vorstellungen von einem Wohnbezirk. Genauso wie jeder übliche Wohnbezirk, hat auch mein Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich die Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk erkunde, ist es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Umgebung: Wohnungen, Wohnhäuser und Wohnheimräume. Zunächst gibt es in den Wohnungen normalerweise 2-4 Personen in jedem Zimmer und etwa 4-6 Zimmer pro Stockwerk. Die häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule gemietet werden können. Diese sind normalerweise 2-4-Zimmer-Setups und werden oft von Absolventen bewohnt. Es gibt jedoch nur einige wenige solcher Häuser, die in den Wohnbezirk verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimräume, in denen Hunderte von Studenten leben. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art von Wohnraum in meinem Wohnbezirk. Nachdem wir das Wohnen behandelt haben, sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule legt großen Wert auf Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es leben Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen in meinem Wohnbezirk. Die meisten Angestellten leben in den Häusern im Wohnbezirk, während die jüngeren Studenten in den Wohnheimen leben und die älteren in der Wohnungsbauart. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk können nicht gerecht werden, indem man einfach darüber spricht, also ist es am besten, zu den Geschäften und Parks in meinem Wohnbezirk überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich ein eigenes, in sich geschlossenes Wohnviertel ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensoptionen, die man in jedem anderen Wohnbezirk finden würde, und die eigenen Marken von Kleidung und Lebensmitteln der Schule. Daher kann man alles innerhalb der Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks finden! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für alle die verschiedenen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk, er wird sauber und kriminell frei gehalten von allen Mitgliedern meines Wohnbezirks!",
            "Well, as I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was quite sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won't lie, I cried, because I missed them and loved them. But my parents and I wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They were enjoyable people that I almost consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, my mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married). It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that is when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd always have a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college that I attend, and I really enjoy living there. Mostly, there are apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and not too expensive. One of the bars was just renamed, and it is more expensive, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have a lower income, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, and I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It's almost offensive. The buildings around me are usually old-looking but might have been renovated. A bit down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them because I think the construction on them wasn't particularly good. They are cheaply built, but the rent is expensive, which I think is a rip-off, but because they are near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There's a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look rundown. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced out in a way that makes them look like individual houses, with the exception that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone here is friendly with each other. We often gather at the end of the street some evenings to chat while the neighborhood's children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly kites. It's very refreshing in this modern, tech-filled world. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white clouds. The only downside? This season, we're having tornado warnings, and last night we heard the actual tornado sirens, so we had to head to shelter. I was in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My larger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop, from 92°F to 75°F in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. Looking up, I saw the sun break through and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and took pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual, with moms and children outside while dinner was cooked. This is a friendly neighborhood for me, who recently moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors, though not all the interiors are the same. Some apartments are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I love walking along the biggest field behind my house to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer here, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters from the surrounding farms. It feels like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories are still here. The same people who lived here when I first moved are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. There are a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never had a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It stands out little from any other in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" which the town proudly displays on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland dominated by peach trees or cattle. Houses not located in the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are not near the road, but further back, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is a single stop light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; strangely enough, they are best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without realizing!",
            "Das erste Mal, als ich von meinem Wohnort hörte, hörte ich ein Podcast über verschwundene Menschen. Es war ein bisschen überraschend. Fast jede Wohnung im Bereich ging für über tausend Dollar pro Monat. Ich hatte noch nie etwas davon gehört, und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht ist es der Kampf. Ich weiß, dass einige meiner Freunde sich nachts in den Schlaf weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Du gewöhntest dich an den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarktspielzeugen und muffiger Kleidung. Du riechst weniger im Erwachsenenalter. Du könntest rauchen oder du könntest einfach zu gewohnt an den Dingen sein. Aber der Flohmarkt drängt sich immer auf. Der Geruch des Erwachsenwerdens ist staubige Magazine, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er sitzt sich in das Leder und bleibt selbst nach dem Waschen. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden in Gehweite. Wenn du auf der anderen Seite beginnst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeitssecond-Hand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen Seltenbuchladen und einen Kuriositätenladen aufsuchen. Downtown ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du würdest es in den Second-Hand-Läden nicht hören. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr gibt es immer mehr von denen. Autos und Menschen strömen herein. Es ist eine sich entwickelnde Stadt, heißt es. Mit Hauptsitz eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung, zeigt es noch wachsende Schmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder ist auf seine eigenen Ziele gerichtet, und niemand fragt wirklich nach dir. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein, und die Stadt lässt dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo Sorge bedeutet, dass man sich kümmert. Man bohrt hier nicht in das Leben der Menschen ein. Du kannst deine Schale so lange tragen, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt rollt und rollt wie Wellen am Strand. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort zu sein. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den beiden Amateurstimmen oben ist immer etwas los. Auf eine Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir versammeln uns für unsere Bedürfnisse, feiern Geburtstage, trauern bei Beerdigungen und helfen einander, wo wir können. Auf eine Weise bin ich froh, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich gut. Ich versuche, dafür zu sorgen, dass ich nach mir selbst reinige und ihnen Essen zurücklasse und sie tun das gleiche für mich. Ich bringe Post zu ihnen und sie zu mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gegenwart so sehr wie ich ihre. Ich lebe in einer riesigen, entmenschlichenden modernen Ausbreitung, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht total ruiniert habe.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as typical cookie cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Occasionally, you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood, you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. They are well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. Regarding the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, is the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly and will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in our town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive attributes. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced bullying so far, thanks to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, so the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial difficulties, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the center of town and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "The neighborhood I live in is full of culture. It is situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. My apartment building, which is seven stories tall, is located directly across from the old live theater, and just a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there is a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the area it's in. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months make it difficult to stay warm. They set their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the wilderness, to keep them warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historical sites - the tall, proud buildings and the architecture that sprawls across the varying levels of the hills rolling down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA sweeping through to clean the streets are still told. The people haven't forgotten. Stories are passed down from generation to generation, including to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, even though it is still considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most dreary nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "**\n\nI live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You have to drive to get anywhere. Despite this, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Da ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Viertel extrem vielfältig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen Geschäftsarealen verstreut, wo eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben wird. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsstätten sind. Es fehlt an neuen Restaurants zum Essen oder Läden zum Einkaufen. Während einige Läden große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, sind kleine Boutiquen ebenfalls sehr beliebt. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern auch in den Straßen, die oft in Gehweite von Wohnvierteln liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn nicht so viele interessante Punkte in der Nähe wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen betrifft, gibt es in meinem Viertel eine bemerkenswerte Vielfalt. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, die jedoch oft in eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt leben. Es gibt Orte wie Korea Town, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch bereits ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein, besonders bei Stau, besonders in der Rushhour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt läuft überall hin, obwohl einige interessante Punkte in der Nähe sind. Die Stadt ist riesig, und die meisten Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Daher haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall einen Parkplatz zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren viel Bauaktivität, da große Wohnblöcke in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebter Ort zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht über die Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen und mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt verschiedene Hausarten. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Apartments und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, andere Duplexe. Dies ist auch innerhalb meines direkten Viertels der Fall, sodass es auch keine Mangel an Wohnungsoptionen gibt. Ähnlich ist das Viertel aus Menschen verschiedenen Alters zusammengesetzt, und ehrlich gesagt kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft, wie ich viele Kindheitserinnerungen habe, in denen ich mit meinem direkten Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Nachbarn aus dem Viertel, die alle in meinem Alter waren, draußen gespielt habe.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but some have been split into two, still attached, if that makes sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this country, but now it's pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was their whole existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called \"Super A\", owned by a large Yemeni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to let cars pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not the kind of place one would expect to find living quarters. At least, not the kind of living quarters that most people would want to live in. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and continue past the hotels which are only occupied annually except for a few summer seasons for family reunions, you'll discover an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, you'll find a few apartment complexes placed carefully next to each other, like Russian nesting dolls that have been meticulously taken apart and set side by side in a line down the road. The first apartments you encounter are those that have made the news for some rather unsavory dealings, so we won't dwell on those too much - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside it, are a different story that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students trickle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for causing traffic jams on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with unfortunate bone breaks on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily rotating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, performing cartwheels and somersaults across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily buzz in the flower patches by the road. Elderly residents walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely to the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a shopping mall beside the park that offers inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the convenience of a shopping mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the quiet south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Kargheit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie war aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenes Gelände gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Häufigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich stammte. Wenn man auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße fährt, erreicht man eine Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt sind. Jenseits davon befindet sich die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen mostly aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens eine halbe Akre Land für sich selbst, um die sich alle kümmern. Im Frühling blühen die alljährlich gepflanzten Blumen, und die mittlere Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit Luxus-Mercedes-Benz-Luxusautos gefüllt, die nach einer gründlichen Waschstraße im Mittagslicht glänzen. Während wir auf mein graues Stuckhaus zufahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines John Deere Zero-Turn-Mähers gehört werden. Jeder im Viertel freut sich über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine wunderbare Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit dem Alter hat er etwas von seinem Witz verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und passt sich mit der Wiese und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mähgerät.",
            "Der erste Punkt, den du über Portland, Oregon verstehen musst, ist der Begriff \"weird\". Das unoffizielle Stadtslogan, auf dem Rücken eines Gebäudes, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musik venue, Stripclub und das Gesetz in mindestens der Hälfte dieser Tätigkeiten umgehen dient, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist dies ein kleiner Aufruf, sich das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er vor Augen zu halten, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Undergroundkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es eine lockende Einladung - komm nach Portland, wo die Menschen dich immer noch als \"weird\" bezeichnen, aber dieses Mal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und dem ständigen Bau von Wohnungen für diese, sind die Baupläne weiterhin \"weird\". \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht, dass wir nicht über moderne Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe verfügen. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge in China. Es gibt Millionen von Weisen, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat mehr als genug Normalität. Portland hat Yoga und Hipster und Geschäftsprofis. Vielleicht bedeutet \"weird\", dass wir einfach alles nicht so ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Nachbarschaften, gibt es bunte Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen und Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straße säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Kostenlose Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die jemanden enthält, der sich von etwas trennt, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, einen Schatz, der perfekt für den Vorbeigehenden ist, oft. Diese Kisten enthalten normalerweise Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das Magische am Durchwandern einer Südostportland-Nachbarschaft ist genau das, was Portland bedeutet. Das ist, was Portland für mich bedeutet, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden Arten von \"weird\". Einige Menschen, unter denen ich lebe, würden sich nie ihre Kleidung aus Kisten auf dem Bürgersteig aussuchen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Ziegengymnastik (ja, Gymnastik mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Spielen der Timbers (der Stadtfußballverein). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihren Träumen nachjagen oder davon träumen, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme sind (in ihrer Ursache) oft psychische Gesundheitsprobleme, und der ständige Regen durch den größten Teil des Jahres, plus die trüben Wolken, scheinen ein Beitrag zu sein. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosigkeitsproblem, mit dem niemand weiß, was zu tun ist. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird von den sozialen Dienstleistungen angelockt, die Portland besser bietet als die meisten anderen Teile des Landes, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind, wie in allen Teilen des Landes, unzureichend. Die nicht-obdachlosen Menschen sind zwischen Fürsorge und Hass gespalten. In diesem Punkt sind wir gar nicht \"weird\".",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they bear witness to the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or get caught up in work and life, they are there, steadfast, unopposing, and undisturbed by life's difficulties. On days when I am the most stressed and worn out, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, giving me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which have their own place in my heart, but it is the mountains that hold the throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that have been home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much bustle and vigor as its neighboring urban city. However, this doesn't last for many blocks, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderful vibe, as if it is inviting you to explore. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with a role to play, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "Falls Bensonhurst in Brooklyn auf Ihrer Besuchsplanung steht, werden Sie es nicht schwer finden! Die öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung ist sehr gut und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsarten in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, so fühlen Sie sich weiterhin, als ob Sie in New York City wären. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich auf die vielen asiatischen Geschäfte vorbereiten, die um Sie herum sind. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst eine Welle von asiatischen Einwohnern erlebt. Daher sehen Sie auf Ihrem Spaziergang mindestens ein asiatisch geführtes Geschäft pro Block. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Diese Unternehmen sind bei den lokalen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. In meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die nur zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Das Adds nur zur Bequemlichkeit des Einkaufs. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, aber es ist sehr vielseitig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten und zweiten Generation amerikanischen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Nähe sind von Asiatischen Unternehmen geführt. Neben den asiatischen Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe mit etwa zehn Basketballplätzen, einem großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätzen, Schaukeln, einem Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einer Wasserfontäne für Kinder, um im Sommer Wasser zu genießen. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielseitig. Sie werden viele Arten von Vielfalt sehen, wo man spielen und gut zusammenarbeiten kann. In diesem Stadtteil gibt es nicht viele große Unternehmensgebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind für das kooperative Wohnen oder für Eigentumswohnungen. Der Großteil der Wohnräume sind Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren oder ständig Gas geben, was Sie morgens früh weckt. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie vorsichtig sein. Dieser Stadtteil ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie könnten auf Menschen treffen, die aus heiterem Himmel Trouble machen, Rowdies und Diebe. Auch ich wurde in diesem Stadtteil in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das ist schon viele Jahre her. Ein jüngster Vorfall betraf das Stehlen von Paketen. Obwohl es hiergangbliche sind, gibt es auch Paketdiebe in diesem Stadtteil. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Gebühr für Menschen erhebt, die ihren Hund nicht aufräumen, befolgen die Menschen hier die Regeln nicht. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn-Station oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größtes Ärgernis sind Hundehaufen überall, wo ich in diesem Stadtteil hingehe. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!",
            "In der Gegend, in der ich lebe, gibt es nicht viele Gehwege. Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt direkt an der Spitze des steilsten Hügels im Viertel. Die Leute nennen es den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Läufer gerne daran entlang joggen, um ihre täglichen Arbeitssitzungen durchzuführen. Da es auf meiner Straße keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen voller Schlaglöcher und kann ein wenig gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block verlaufen, sehen zerschlissen aus. Bei uns regnet und stürmt es oft, daher bekommen die Stromleitungen häufig von Ästen und anderen Schmutzpartikeln getroffen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussehen, als ob sie mit Flicken überzogen wären. Überall, wohin man auch schaut, gibt es hohe Nadelbäume. Die Einheimischen hassen diese Bäume, weil sie die Sicht auf den Ozean versperren. Daher sind viele Häuser auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen gläsernen zweiten Stockwerken, die sich an der Bucht erheben. Es ist wunderschön am Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird, aber es ist oft bewölkt, so dass man die Sonne durch eine Dunstschicht sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal habe ich mein Auto einen Monat lang im Driveway stehen lassen und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig geworden. Es hat drei Stunden gedauert, das Moos abzu kratzen. In meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es nicht viele Kinder, aber es gibt eine Schule nur ein paar Blocks entfernt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter und viele von ihnen sind im Ruhestand. Statt Kinder haben die meisten Menschen Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Gärten oder die Straße entlang rennen zu sehen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus eindringen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn durch die Vordertür hinausscheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige sind gut gebaut, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasen der Menschen graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten aus der Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und manchmal schwebt ein Habicht oder ein Adler vorbei, bis die Nachbarschaftskrähen ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man ein paar Blocks bergab zum Wasser geht, gibt es einige Restaurants, die frischen Seefisch servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind Spaß, wenn man Steine ins Wasser wirft. Die Bucht ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste auch durch den Nebel hindurch klar sehen.",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but supposedly most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people, I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want to shop, you have to travel. I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, I would say, not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is because this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's also where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and that are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.",
            "Wenn man mich nach meiner Nachbarschaft fragt, ist meine Antwort sicherlich etwas einzigartig. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit ihrem eigenen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein wenig anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als den Campus, auf dem ich lebe, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte den umliegenden Campus auch als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Eigenartigkeit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den üblichen Vorstellungen von einem Wohnbezirk. Genauso wie jeder übliche Wohnbezirk, hat auch mein Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich die Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk erkunde, ist es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Umgebung: Wohnungen, Wohnhäuser und Wohnheimräume. Zunächst gibt es in den Wohnungen normalerweise 2-4 Personen in jedem Zimmer und etwa 4-6 Zimmer pro Stockwerk. Die häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule gemietet werden können. Diese sind normalerweise 2-4-Zimmer-Setups und werden oft von Absolventen bewohnt. Es gibt jedoch nur einige wenige solcher Häuser, die in den Wohnbezirk verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimräume, in denen Hunderte von Studenten leben. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art von Wohnraum in meinem Wohnbezirk. Nachdem wir das Wohnen behandelt haben, sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule legt großen Wert auf Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich auch in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es leben Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen in meinem Wohnbezirk. Die meisten Angestellten leben in den Häusern im Wohnbezirk, während die jüngeren Studenten in den Wohnheimen leben und die älteren in der Wohnungsbauart. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk können nicht gerecht werden, indem man einfach darüber spricht, also ist es am besten, zu den Geschäften und Parks in meinem Wohnbezirk überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich ein eigenes, in sich geschlossenes Wohnviertel ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensoptionen, die man in jedem anderen Wohnbezirk finden würde, und die eigenen Marken von Kleidung und Lebensmitteln der Schule. Daher kann man alles innerhalb der Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks finden! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für alle die verschiedenen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk, er wird sauber und kriminell frei gehalten von allen Mitgliedern meines Wohnbezirks!",
            "Well, as I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was quite sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won't lie, I cried, because I missed them and loved them. But my parents and I wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They were enjoyable people that I almost consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, my mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married). It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that is when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd always have a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college that I attend, and I really enjoy living there. Mostly, there are apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and not too expensive. One of the bars was just renamed, and it is more expensive, but the service and drinks aren't bad. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have a lower income, as the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, and I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It's almost offensive. The buildings around me are usually old-looking but might have been renovated. A bit down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them because I think the construction on them wasn't particularly good. They are cheaply built, but the rent is expensive, which I think is a rip-off, but because they are near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There's a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a row of trees and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look rundown. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. They are spaced out in a way that makes them look like individual houses, with the exception that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone here is friendly with each other. We often gather at the end of the street some evenings to chat while the neighborhood's children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly kites. It's very refreshing in this modern, tech-filled world. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white clouds. The only downside? This season, we're having tornado warnings, and last night we heard the actual tornado sirens, so we had to head to shelter. I was in my bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My larger dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop, from 92°F to 75°F in just a few minutes. The hail melted instantly on the hot pavement. Looking up, I saw the sun break through and a double rainbow appeared. I grabbed my camera and took pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were amazed, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour before people started returning home. Then it was business as usual, with moms and children outside while dinner was cooked. This is a friendly neighborhood for me, who recently moved from NH to NC. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, as do most of my neighbors, though not all the interiors are the same. Some apartments are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me. I love walking along the biggest field behind my house to the pond, which isn't meant for swimming. I've seen deer here, and in the morning, you can hear the giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside of Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters from the surrounding farms. It feels like living in a small, self-contained community. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he's there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I eventually got close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories are still here. The same people who lived here when I first moved are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. There are a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never had a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. It stands out little from any other in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" which the town proudly displays on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland dominated by peach trees or cattle. Houses not located in the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are not near the road, but further back, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is a single stop light at a four-way intersection, where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; strangely enough, they are best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through in the blink of an eye without realizing!",
            "Das erste Mal, als ich von meinem Wohnort hörte, hörte ich ein Podcast über verschwundene Menschen. Es war ein bisschen überraschend. Fast jede Wohnung im Bereich ging für über tausend Dollar pro Monat. Ich hatte noch nie etwas davon gehört, und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht ist es der Kampf. Ich weiß, dass einige meiner Freunde sich nachts in den Schlaf weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Du gewöhntest dich an den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarktspielzeugen und muffiger Kleidung. Du riechst weniger im Erwachsenenalter. Du könntest rauchen oder du könntest einfach zu gewohnt an den Dingen sein. Aber der Flohmarkt drängt sich immer auf. Der Geruch des Erwachsenwerdens ist staubige Magazine, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er sitzt sich in das Leder und bleibt selbst nach dem Waschen. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden in Gehweite. Wenn du auf der anderen Seite beginnst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeitssecond-Hand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen Seltenbuchladen und einen Kuriositätenladen aufsuchen. Downtown ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du würdest es in den Second-Hand-Läden nicht hören. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr gibt es immer mehr von denen. Autos und Menschen strömen herein. Es ist eine sich entwickelnde Stadt, heißt es. Mit Hauptsitz eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung, zeigt es noch wachsende Schmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder ist auf seine eigenen Ziele gerichtet, und niemand fragt wirklich nach dir. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein, und die Stadt lässt dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo Sorge bedeutet, dass man sich kümmert. Man bohrt hier nicht in das Leben der Menschen ein. Du kannst deine Schale so lange tragen, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt rollt und rollt wie Wellen am Strand. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort zu sein. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den beiden Amateurstimmen oben ist immer etwas los. Auf eine Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir versammeln uns für unsere Bedürfnisse, feiern Geburtstage, trauern bei Beerdigungen und helfen einander, wo wir können. Auf eine Weise bin ich froh, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich gut. Ich versuche, dafür zu sorgen, dass ich nach mir selbst reinige und ihnen Essen zurücklasse und sie tun das gleiche für mich. Ich bringe Post zu ihnen und sie zu mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gegenwart so sehr wie ich ihre. Ich lebe in einer riesigen, entmenschlichenden modernen Ausbreitung, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht total ruiniert habe.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as typical cookie cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Occasionally, you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood, you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access to their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. They are well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. Regarding the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, is the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly and will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still relatively low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than the occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. The town has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" affecting many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in our town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, the town has many positive attributes. My son's elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced bullying so far, thanks to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, so the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No child or family is treated as \"less than\" due to financial difficulties, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the town's appearance, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the center of town and on the west side, where all the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side, where I live, tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention among my neighbors. Overall, I enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options to meet our family's needs, and while our home may not be worth much, it is comfortable and adequate. We have lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "The neighborhood I live in is full of culture. It is situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. My apartment building, which is seven stories tall, is located directly across from the old live theater, and just a block down The Hill is a cool little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, there is a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the area it's in. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs built into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months make it difficult to stay warm. They set their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the wilderness, to keep them warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of its historical sites - the tall, proud buildings and the architecture that sprawls across the varying levels of the hills rolling down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories of the federal government and DEA sweeping through to clean the streets are still told. The people haven't forgotten. Stories are passed down from generation to generation, including to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, even though it is still considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city and on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I travel, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most dreary nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "**\n\nI live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. You have to drive to get anywhere. Despite this, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "In the large city where I live, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. Residential areas are scattered, seemingly haphazardly, between commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, others are various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new restaurants to dine at or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular. They aren't just located in malls, but also line the streets, which are often within walking distance of otherwise quiet and serene neighborhoods. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I've noticed that people frequently visit these parks with their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's actually quite a bit of diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further afield, there are many more people of various races and origins, though they often gather in their own small communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can feel like a long drive. A 10-mile drive can sometimes take two hours, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere; while some points of interest are close by, the city is huge, and people generally prefer to commute by car. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots is a challenge. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction recently, with many new apartment buildings being added to the city. It seems like a popular destination, but many residents are dismayed by the prospect of even more people moving in and more cars on the roads. There are various types of houses in my city; not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas consist of houses of different sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, others have duplexes. This is true even within my immediate neighborhood, so there's also diversity in housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is diverse in terms of age, and to be honest, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, though I have many childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few that have been split into two, while still being attached. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like many others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now it seems to be pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemeni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of recent titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – after all, it’s a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would expect to find places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and across the street from the hotels that are only occupied annually, except for a few summer family reunions, you’ll discover an entire thriving community. Within these communities, on these streets, you’ll find a handful of apartment complexes – situated next to each other carefully, like Russian nesting dolls that have been meticulously, carefully disassembled and placed in a row down the road, piece by piece. The first apartments you come across are those that have been in the news for some rather unsavory dealings, so we won’t dwell on those too much – appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college’s satellite campus – a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentry beside the road, where students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with bone fractures on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily rotating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, performing cartwheels and twirls across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, glaring at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There’s a sushi place in a shopping mall beside the park that offers affordable food but never seems too busy – a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once – the beauty of a shopping mall. There’s also a frozen yogurt place there, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with toppings while they perform stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana – a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "The first thing you should understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and pushes the boundaries of legality in at least half of these activities, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a plea to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of things that are often not accepted. We're not devoid of modern conveniences or modern issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, but Portland has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Maybe weirdness just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. These are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They hold something magical, a treasure for the passerby, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes often contain clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among many. Some of my neighbors wouldn't dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Portland Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love many things. Portland is full of people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from mental health problems, and the persistent rain and dreary clouds throughout much of the year don't help. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a problem that no one seems to know how to address. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are generally better than in most other parts of the country, but they are still insufficient. The non-homeless population oscillates between caring and hostility. In this, Portland is no different from other places.",
            "Die Berge sind immer da. Im Norden, sie bezeugen die Sonnenaufgänge und -untergänge jeden Morgen und jeden Abend. Egal, wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich in Arbeit und Leben aufgehen mag, sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unangestrengt und unberührt von den Herausforderungen des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich besonders gestresst und aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich zu ihnen schaue, lassen sie meine ängstliche Seele zur Ruhe kommen und geben mir die Kraft, weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich bin hierhergezogen, als ich mit meinem Studium begann, und die Berge im Norden des Campus haben mich sofort in ihren Bann gezogen. Natürlich hat die Universität auch ihre eigenen beeindruckenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die ebenfalls einen Teil meines Herzens beanspruchen, aber es sind die Berge, die den Thron innehaben. Der Rest der Stadt ist in seinen eigenen Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen ich viele Stunden mit kaffeegetriebenem Lernen verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus ein Stück weiter zur Innenstadt fahren und in eine Atmosphäre des Altertums eintauchen, die durch die verblassten bunten Ziegelsteine, die die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen, entsteht. Hier zeigt diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt genauso viel Hektik und Vitalität wie ihre städtische Nachbarschaft. Dies hält jedoch nicht lange an, da man erneut in die friedliche Kleinstadt fliehen kann, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbei geht. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in so naher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt ein wunderbares Vibe, als ob sie zu erkunden aufgerufen wird. So ist es leicht, viele wertvolle Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Egal ob es bedeutet, an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park nach einer durchwachsener Nacht mit Freunden vorbeizugehen oder durch die belebte Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film in dem luxuriösen Kino zu erwischen, für das die Universität Tickets bereitstellte. Leider ist es auch ein Heim für viele harte Erinnerungen, wie es in allen Orten in unserem Leben der Fall ist. Die Seen, insbesondere, können ein passender Ort zum Nachdenken und zum Weinen um zwei Uhr morgens während einer existentiellen Krise sein. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung. Während ich den Turtles und Enten und Insekten dabei zusehe, wie sie ihr Leben leben, jeder mit einer bestimmten Rolle, kann ich nicht anders, als über meinen eigenen Sinn und Zweck nachzudenken, während ich versuche, dieses Mysterium namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich an dem See vorbei und an dem Park und den kleinen Häusern, die von Suburbanität schreien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre brillanten Strahlen über die Palmen warf, den Himmel entlang malte und als ich nach oben sah, erkannte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Natürlich, sie waren da, wie immer. Die festen, überwältigenden Berge durchbohrten den nebeligen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, weckten sie in mir den Drang zum Durchhalten.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to slope downwards, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workout. Since there aren't any sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often take down the power lines, making the constant repairs look disjointed and patchwork-like. There are many tall evergreen trees all around; you can see them everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month, and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good-sized, and the gardeners hate them because they dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront, there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people who live here. They usually keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily chores. In winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live on the corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and recognize the cars that people drive. We take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs. Children bike around as you'd expect. We stay at home a lot since we work from home. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. So, everyone here is used to us coming and going as well. We often play outside, even in the rain. We grill on our back deck occasionally, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. Someone is always cutting grass here from March through October, the lawn mower hums nearly every day. The neighborhood was originally wooded and has plenty of trees, which means lots of shade but also leaves in the fall. So, we rake and burn the leaves annually. I like the smell of burning leaves, so it's a nice sign of fall. This year, we've had very little winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which doesn't happen often. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite peaceful. Thanksgiving sees some neighbors visiting with out-of-town family, and there are extra cars parked during that time. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a lot of money on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing the same way. Most of the time, the people are very friendly, but just like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people, so I guess it's a nice neighborhood. The stores in this area are pretty much the chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to experience upscale, you have to travel because I've never really seen any Whole Foods or stores like that. The most prominent jobs in my city, based on my observations, would be construction. I think this is because our city is still not very developed, and there's still a lot of open space to build. That kind of scares me, as I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, this was the field my full-time job is located in - I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As I'm writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can provide a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. Drop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond are likely to be homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory to be my community. Furthermore, I view the surrounding campus as a part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with more conventional ideas. Just like any conventional neighborhood, it has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's best to clarify the types of housing in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory-style housing. In the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings house around 20 people on average. Next, there are actual houses available to rent for those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom apartments, often inhabited by alumni. However, these are less common, with only a few scattered throughout the neighborhood. Finally, there are the dormitory rooms, which house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and these are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nWith housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school emphasizes diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and age groups living here. Most professional staff reside in houses within the neighborhood, while newer students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students in apartment-style housing. It's challenging to do justice to the people here with mere words, so let's move on to the stores and parks.\n\nSince my school essentially forms its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options found anywhere else, along with unique clothing and grocery stores. As a result, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries. Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse population, and it is kept clean and safe by all the residents.",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which I quite enjoy. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to without breaking the bank. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but offers decent service and drinks. Most people are friendly, either college students or lower-income residents, as the housing is quite affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, which is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, and I don't mind. They are quite fond of smoking weed, and the building management has installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. Most of the buildings are old and might have been recently renovated on the inside. Further down the street, there are brand-new apartment buildings, but I don't like them, as the construction quality is poor despite the expensive rent due to their proximity to campus. There's a budget restaurant about five minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, known for not being a great place to work. However, the road was recently improved with city funds, adding sidewalks, grassy medians, and making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my complex is another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind it, which is less appealing. The sidewalks there are in poor condition, and many buildings look rundown, with trees lining the street to hide the dilapidated buildings. Most crime in the area has occurred at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but similar issues exist across the street from me as well. Despite it all, I like living here because I can afford it and there are plenty of amenities nearby, especially the university, which is within walking distance and has two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My Nachbarschaft besteht aus Doppelhäusern auf einer Sackgasse. Sie sind abwechselnd und so platziert, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes gelb gestrichen, mit weißen Verandas und grünen Metalldächern ist. Fast jeder, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends am Ende eines nicht vorgegebenen Fahrweges und unterhalten uns, während die kleinen Kinder des Viertels mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, von Maschinen und Computern dominierten Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Zeitreise. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße Wolken betont werden. Der einzige Nachteil? Dieses Jahr erleben wir Tornadowarnungen, und gestern Abend haben wir zum ersten Mal echte Tornadosirenen gehört, sodass wir uns in Sicherheit gebracht haben. Natürlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, wo ich meinen kleinsten Hund in den Armen hielt, zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen. Mein größerer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, weil die Situation unheimlich war. Das Nachbarschaft war still, außer dem Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf den Boden fiel. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße förmlich, weil die Temperatur so schnell von 92 auf 75 fiel. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben schaute, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren genauso beeindruckt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben eine weitere Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wo immer sie gewesen waren, als das Unwetter losging. Dann ging das Leben wieder seinen gewohnten Gang. Mütter und Kinder spielten wieder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Solch ein freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Zweizimmerwohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, wie alle anderen auch. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Wohnungen drinnen nicht alle gleich. Einige sind sogar sehr klein. Es macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, am größten Feld hinter meinem Haus entlang zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Dort habe ich Rehe gesehen und morgens kann man den riesigen Frosch seine Melodie hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zum Leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb von Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man vom Krähen der Hühner aus den umliegenden Farmen geweckt. Es fühlt sich fast an wie in einem eigenen kleinen Dorf. Es gibt sogar einen Esel auf einem nahen Hof, der abends brayt, um uns wissen zu lassen, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, dieses Juwel einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.",
            "(German translation and retranslation)\n\nIch bin in dieses Viertel gezogen, kurz bevor ich mit der achten Klasse angefangen habe. Es war schwierig, Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich schließlich mit jemandem angefreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter wohnt, und einem anderen Jungen, der in meiner Straße lebt. Beide wohnen jetzt nicht mehr hier, aber die Erinnerungen sind geblieben. Die meisten Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, sind noch hier. Mein Viertel ähnelt einem durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Vorort. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser. An den Wochenenden oder wann immer es warm ist, höre ich die Kinder nach draußen spielen. Das Viertel ist tagsüber oft ruhig. Ich hatte noch nie ein Problem mit den Leuten hier. Sie lassen dich in Ruhe, es sei denn, du brauchst Hilfe. Ich habe online mehrfach Pakete bestellt und hatte noch nie ein Problem mit gestohlenen Paketen von meiner Veranda. Ich vertraue meinen Nachbarn. Es gibt einen Park, der nur ein paar Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt ist. Ich habe dort viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort mit anderen Jungs im Viertel Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Auch meine schlechteste Erinnerung stammt von dort, als ich mir beim Fußballspielen die Nase stoß, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen. Heute gehe ich dorthin, um Zeit mit meinen Cousins' Kindern zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und lieben es, auf Schaukeln und Rutschen zu spielen. Allein der Gedanke, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich sehr nostalgisch, aus verschiedenen Gründen. Das Viertel ist sehr vielseitig. In der Umgebung gibt es verschiedene Essensmöglichkeiten. Innerhalb eines Kilometerradius findest du chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heute nutzen viele Menschen Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensplätze sind die Fast-Food-Shops, aber die gibt es sowieso in fast jedem Vorort. Es gibt auch viele Pizza-Läden. Die Geschäfte hier bieten alles, was man je braucht. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungen in der Nähe. Es gibt eine Walgreens und eine CVS auf derselben Straße wie einen Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der in der Mitte des Landes beliebt ist. Einige Geschäfte sind auch vielseitig, wie ein von Indern geführter Laden, falls du mal indische Küche machen oder fertige indische Gerichte kaufen möchtest. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meines Viertels. Wenn ich auf Social Media lese und Nachrichten sehe, wie andere Menschen Horrorgeschichten über ihre Nachbarn erleben, bin ich dankbar für meine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from the others in South Carolina, but it's significant for the local agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and the town proudly announces this on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses that are not in the town center are widely spaced and often two-story, with either metal roofs to withstand the hot summers or gray shingles. These houses are usually farther back from the road to allow for the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at an intersection, where all the town's stores are located. There are three places you can get fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also a small, expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it's the only grocery store in town, many people only stop by for a few items and prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store in town is Dollar General; it offers a wide range of everyday items and is always busy. There's a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been around for many years and employs two movers for furniture deliveries. Attached to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located away from the town center; they're small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town once they finish fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to provide more family outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the limited activities, it's a pleasant town, so small that you could pass through it without noticing.",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're three thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "**\n\nI live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, can be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill is this cool little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you'll see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large for the area it's in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall staircases leading up. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it hard to stay warm. Being close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them warmer. They're also nearby the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historical buildings—the tall, proud structures, the architecture decorating the varying levels of the hills rolling down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence. You still hear stories about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through, trying to clean the streets. The people remember. Stories are passed down from generation to generation, even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, despite the neighborhood being considered one of the roughest in the city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night. This warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's also aware of the reminders that plague our nation. No matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've offered me a jacket more quickly and rarely nefariously than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few extra minutes so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to hide from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to get anywhere you need to go, but I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They are not cookie-cutter homes but older, updated and remodeled houses. Most homes have full basements that can be seen from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses in every color you can imagine in the blocks around my house. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America with hard-working people who are either raising or have raised families. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can tell who fits in and who doesn't. You'll see someone grilling outside and wave or someone walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are well-maintained. There are no piles of leaves from fall. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed down. It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into thinking \"wow, look at the nice homes,\" but one you drive into thinking \"this would be a good place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it might not look exceptional, it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to end the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff's department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcer keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to the fields. You can be playing outside or inside and hear the sound of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you're really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It's a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "In the large city where I live, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. Residential areas are scattered, seemingly haphazardly, between commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, others are various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new restaurants to dine at or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular. They aren't just located in malls, but also line the streets, which are often within walking distance of otherwise quiet and serene neighborhoods. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I've noticed that people frequently visit these parks with their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's actually quite a bit of diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further afield, there are many more people of various races and origins, though they often gather in their own small communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can feel like a long drive. A 10-mile drive can sometimes take two hours, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere; while some points of interest are close by, the city is huge, and people generally prefer to commute by car. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots is a challenge. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction recently, with many new apartment buildings being added to the city. It seems like a popular destination, but many residents are dismayed by the prospect of even more people moving in and more cars on the roads. There are various types of houses in my city; not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas consist of houses of different sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, others have duplexes. This is true even within my immediate neighborhood, so there's also diversity in housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is diverse in terms of age, and to be honest, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, though I have many childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few that have been split into two, while still being attached. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like many others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now it seems to be pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemeni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of recent titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – after all, it’s a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would expect to find places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and across the street from the hotels that are only occupied annually, except for a few summer family reunions, you’ll discover an entire thriving community. Within these communities, on these streets, you’ll find a handful of apartment complexes – situated next to each other carefully, like Russian nesting dolls that have been meticulously, carefully disassembled and placed in a row down the road, piece by piece. The first apartments you come across are those that have been in the news for some rather unsavory dealings, so we won’t dwell on those too much – appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college’s satellite campus – a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentry beside the road, where students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with bone fractures on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily rotating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, performing cartwheels and twirls across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, glaring at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There’s a sushi place in a shopping mall beside the park that offers affordable food but never seems too busy – a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once – the beauty of a shopping mall. There’s also a frozen yogurt place there, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with toppings while they perform stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana – a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "The first thing you should understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and pushes the boundaries of legality in at least half of these activities, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a plea to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of things that are often not accepted. We're not devoid of modern conveniences or modern issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, but Portland has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Maybe weirdness just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. These are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They hold something magical, a treasure for the passerby, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes often contain clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among many. Some of my neighbors wouldn't dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Portland Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love many things. Portland is full of people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from mental health problems, and the persistent rain and dreary clouds throughout much of the year don't help. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a problem that no one seems to know how to address. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are generally better than in most other parts of the country, but they are still insufficient. The non-homeless population oscillates between caring and hostility. In this, Portland is no different from other places.",
            "Die Berge sind immer da. Im Norden, sie bezeugen die Sonnenaufgänge und -untergänge jeden Morgen und jeden Abend. Egal, wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich in Arbeit und Leben aufgehen mag, sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unangestrengt und unberührt von den Herausforderungen des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich besonders gestresst und aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich zu ihnen schaue, lassen sie meine ängstliche Seele zur Ruhe kommen und geben mir die Kraft, weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich bin hierhergezogen, als ich mit meinem Studium begann, und die Berge im Norden des Campus haben mich sofort in ihren Bann gezogen. Natürlich hat die Universität auch ihre eigenen beeindruckenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die ebenfalls einen Teil meines Herzens beanspruchen, aber es sind die Berge, die den Thron innehaben. Der Rest der Stadt ist in seinen eigenen Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen ich viele Stunden mit kaffeegetriebenem Lernen verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus ein Stück weiter zur Innenstadt fahren und in eine Atmosphäre des Altertums eintauchen, die durch die verblassten bunten Ziegelsteine, die die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen, entsteht. Hier zeigt diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt genauso viel Hektik und Vitalität wie ihre städtische Nachbarschaft. Dies hält jedoch nicht lange an, da man erneut in die friedliche Kleinstadt fliehen kann, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbei geht. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in so naher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt ein wunderbares Vibe, als ob sie zu erkunden aufgerufen wird. So ist es leicht, viele wertvolle Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Egal ob es bedeutet, an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park nach einer durchwachsener Nacht mit Freunden vorbeizugehen oder durch die belebte Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film in dem luxuriösen Kino zu erwischen, für das die Universität Tickets bereitstellte. Leider ist es auch ein Heim für viele harte Erinnerungen, wie es in allen Orten in unserem Leben der Fall ist. Die Seen, insbesondere, können ein passender Ort zum Nachdenken und zum Weinen um zwei Uhr morgens während einer existentiellen Krise sein. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung. Während ich den Turtles und Enten und Insekten dabei zusehe, wie sie ihr Leben leben, jeder mit einer bestimmten Rolle, kann ich nicht anders, als über meinen eigenen Sinn und Zweck nachzudenken, während ich versuche, dieses Mysterium namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich an dem See vorbei und an dem Park und den kleinen Häusern, die von Suburbanität schreien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre brillanten Strahlen über die Palmen warf, den Himmel entlang malte und als ich nach oben sah, erkannte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Natürlich, sie waren da, wie immer. Die festen, überwältigenden Berge durchbohrten den nebeligen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, weckten sie in mir den Drang zum Durchhalten.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to slope downwards, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workout. Since there aren't any sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often take down the power lines, making the constant repairs look disjointed and patchwork-like. There are many tall evergreen trees all around; you can see them everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month, and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good-sized, and the gardeners hate them because they dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront, there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people who live here. They usually keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily chores. In winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live on the corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and recognize the cars that people drive. We take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs. Children bike around as you'd expect. We stay at home a lot since we work from home. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. So, everyone here is used to us coming and going as well. We often play outside, even in the rain. We grill on our back deck occasionally, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. Someone is always cutting grass here from March through October, the lawn mower hums nearly every day. The neighborhood was originally wooded and has plenty of trees, which means lots of shade but also leaves in the fall. So, we rake and burn the leaves annually. I like the smell of burning leaves, so it's a nice sign of fall. This year, we've had very little winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which doesn't happen often. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite peaceful. Thanksgiving sees some neighbors visiting with out-of-town family, and there are extra cars parked during that time. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a lot of money on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing the same way. Most of the time, the people are very friendly, but just like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people, so I guess it's a nice neighborhood. The stores in this area are pretty much the chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to experience upscale, you have to travel because I've never really seen any Whole Foods or stores like that. The most prominent jobs in my city, based on my observations, would be construction. I think this is because our city is still not very developed, and there's still a lot of open space to build. That kind of scares me, as I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, this was the field my full-time job is located in - I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As I'm writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can provide a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. Drop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond are likely to be homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory to be my community. Furthermore, I view the surrounding campus as a part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with more conventional ideas. Just like any conventional neighborhood, it has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's best to clarify the types of housing in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory-style housing. In the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings house around 20 people on average. Next, there are actual houses available to rent for those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom apartments, often inhabited by alumni. However, these are less common, with only a few scattered throughout the neighborhood. Finally, there are the dormitory rooms, which house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and these are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nWith housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school emphasizes diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and age groups living here. Most professional staff reside in houses within the neighborhood, while newer students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students in apartment-style housing. It's challenging to do justice to the people here with mere words, so let's move on to the stores and parks.\n\nSince my school essentially forms its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options found anywhere else, along with unique clothing and grocery stores. As a result, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries. Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse population, and it is kept clean and safe by all the residents.",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which I quite enjoy. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to without breaking the bank. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but offers decent service and drinks. Most people are friendly, either college students or lower-income residents, as the housing is quite affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, which is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, and I don't mind. They are quite fond of smoking weed, and the building management has installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. Most of the buildings are old and might have been recently renovated on the inside. Further down the street, there are brand-new apartment buildings, but I don't like them, as the construction quality is poor despite the expensive rent due to their proximity to campus. There's a budget restaurant about five minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, known for not being a great place to work. However, the road was recently improved with city funds, adding sidewalks, grassy medians, and making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my complex is another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind it, which is less appealing. The sidewalks there are in poor condition, and many buildings look rundown, with trees lining the street to hide the dilapidated buildings. Most crime in the area has occurred at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but similar issues exist across the street from me as well. Despite it all, I like living here because I can afford it and there are plenty of amenities nearby, especially the university, which is within walking distance and has two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My Nachbarschaft besteht aus Doppelhäusern auf einer Sackgasse. Sie sind abwechselnd und so platziert, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes gelb gestrichen, mit weißen Verandas und grünen Metalldächern ist. Fast jeder, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends am Ende eines nicht vorgegebenen Fahrweges und unterhalten uns, während die kleinen Kinder des Viertels mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, von Maschinen und Computern dominierten Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Zeitreise. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße Wolken betont werden. Der einzige Nachteil? Dieses Jahr erleben wir Tornadowarnungen, und gestern Abend haben wir zum ersten Mal echte Tornadosirenen gehört, sodass wir uns in Sicherheit gebracht haben. Natürlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, wo ich meinen kleinsten Hund in den Armen hielt, zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen. Mein größerer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, weil die Situation unheimlich war. Das Nachbarschaft war still, außer dem Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf den Boden fiel. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße förmlich, weil die Temperatur so schnell von 92 auf 75 fiel. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben schaute, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren genauso beeindruckt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben eine weitere Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wo immer sie gewesen waren, als das Unwetter losging. Dann ging das Leben wieder seinen gewohnten Gang. Mütter und Kinder spielten wieder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Solch ein freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Zweizimmerwohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, wie alle anderen auch. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Wohnungen drinnen nicht alle gleich. Einige sind sogar sehr klein. Es macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, am größten Feld hinter meinem Haus entlang zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Dort habe ich Rehe gesehen und morgens kann man den riesigen Frosch seine Melodie hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zum Leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb von Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man vom Krähen der Hühner aus den umliegenden Farmen geweckt. Es fühlt sich fast an wie in einem eigenen kleinen Dorf. Es gibt sogar einen Esel auf einem nahen Hof, der abends brayt, um uns wissen zu lassen, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, dieses Juwel einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.",
            "(German translation and retranslation)\n\nIch bin in dieses Viertel gezogen, kurz bevor ich mit der achten Klasse angefangen habe. Es war schwierig, Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich schließlich mit jemandem angefreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter wohnt, und einem anderen Jungen, der in meiner Straße lebt. Beide wohnen jetzt nicht mehr hier, aber die Erinnerungen sind geblieben. Die meisten Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, sind noch hier. Mein Viertel ähnelt einem durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Vorort. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser. An den Wochenenden oder wann immer es warm ist, höre ich die Kinder nach draußen spielen. Das Viertel ist tagsüber oft ruhig. Ich hatte noch nie ein Problem mit den Leuten hier. Sie lassen dich in Ruhe, es sei denn, du brauchst Hilfe. Ich habe online mehrfach Pakete bestellt und hatte noch nie ein Problem mit gestohlenen Paketen von meiner Veranda. Ich vertraue meinen Nachbarn. Es gibt einen Park, der nur ein paar Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt ist. Ich habe dort viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort mit anderen Jungs im Viertel Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Auch meine schlechteste Erinnerung stammt von dort, als ich mir beim Fußballspielen die Nase stoß, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen. Heute gehe ich dorthin, um Zeit mit meinen Cousins' Kindern zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und lieben es, auf Schaukeln und Rutschen zu spielen. Allein der Gedanke, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich sehr nostalgisch, aus verschiedenen Gründen. Das Viertel ist sehr vielseitig. In der Umgebung gibt es verschiedene Essensmöglichkeiten. Innerhalb eines Kilometerradius findest du chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heute nutzen viele Menschen Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensplätze sind die Fast-Food-Shops, aber die gibt es sowieso in fast jedem Vorort. Es gibt auch viele Pizza-Läden. Die Geschäfte hier bieten alles, was man je braucht. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungen in der Nähe. Es gibt eine Walgreens und eine CVS auf derselben Straße wie einen Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der in der Mitte des Landes beliebt ist. Einige Geschäfte sind auch vielseitig, wie ein von Indern geführter Laden, falls du mal indische Küche machen oder fertige indische Gerichte kaufen möchtest. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meines Viertels. Wenn ich auf Social Media lese und Nachrichten sehe, wie andere Menschen Horrorgeschichten über ihre Nachbarn erleben, bin ich dankbar für meine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from the others in South Carolina, but it's significant for the local agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and the town proudly announces this on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses that are not in the town center are widely spaced and often two-story, with either metal roofs to withstand the hot summers or gray shingles. These houses are usually farther back from the road to allow for the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at an intersection, where all the town's stores are located. There are three places you can get fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also a small, expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it's the only grocery store in town, many people only stop by for a few items and prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store in town is Dollar General; it offers a wide range of everyday items and is always busy. There's a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been around for many years and employs two movers for furniture deliveries. Attached to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located away from the town center; they're small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town once they finish fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to provide more family outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the limited activities, it's a pleasant town, so small that you could pass through it without noticing.",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're three thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "**\n\nI live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, can be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill is this cool little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you'll see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large for the area it's in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall staircases leading up. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it hard to stay warm. Being close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them warmer. They're also nearby the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historical buildings—the tall, proud structures, the architecture decorating the varying levels of the hills rolling down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence. You still hear stories about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through, trying to clean the streets. The people remember. Stories are passed down from generation to generation, even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, despite the neighborhood being considered one of the roughest in the city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night. This warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's also aware of the reminders that plague our nation. No matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've offered me a jacket more quickly and rarely nefariously than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few extra minutes so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to hide from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to get anywhere you need to go, but I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They are not cookie-cutter homes but older, updated and remodeled houses. Most homes have full basements that can be seen from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses in every color you can imagine in the blocks around my house. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America with hard-working people who are either raising or have raised families. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can tell who fits in and who doesn't. You'll see someone grilling outside and wave or someone walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are well-maintained. There are no piles of leaves from fall. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed down. It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into thinking \"wow, look at the nice homes,\" but one you drive into thinking \"this would be a good place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it might not look exceptional, it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to end the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff's department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcer keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to the fields. You can be playing outside or inside and hear the sound of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you're really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It's a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "In the large city where I live, my neighborhood is surprisingly diverse. Residential areas are scattered, seemingly haphazardly, between commercial zones, where a variety of businesses operate. Some of these businesses are offices, others are various stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new restaurants to dine at or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by big corporations, small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular. They aren't just located in malls, but also line the streets, which are often within walking distance of otherwise quiet and serene neighborhoods. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I've noticed that people frequently visit these parks with their young children. Speaking of the residents, there's actually quite a bit of diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Further afield, there are many more people of various races and origins, though they often gather in their own small communities within the city. We have areas known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, just a few miles away. However, even a short distance can feel like a long drive. A 10-mile drive can sometimes take two hours, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere; while some points of interest are close by, the city is huge, and people generally prefer to commute by car. Consequently, we have some of the worst traffic in the world, and finding parking spots is a challenge. Ironically, there's been a lot of construction recently, with many new apartment buildings being added to the city. It seems like a popular destination, but many residents are dismayed by the prospect of even more people moving in and more cars on the roads. There are various types of houses in my city; not everyone lives in large apartment buildings. Residential areas consist of houses of different sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties have single-family homes, others have duplexes. This is true even within my immediate neighborhood, so there's also diversity in housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is diverse in terms of age, and to be honest, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors. It's not a close-knit community these days, though I have many childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the neighborhood.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few that have been split into two, while still being attached. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like many others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now it seems to be pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems to conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemeni family, who are quite possibly the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of recent titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "You might overlook it at first glance – after all, it’s a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would expect to find places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and across the street from the hotels that are only occupied annually, except for a few summer family reunions, you’ll discover an entire thriving community. Within these communities, on these streets, you’ll find a handful of apartment complexes – situated next to each other carefully, like Russian nesting dolls that have been meticulously, carefully disassembled and placed in a row down the road, piece by piece. The first apartments you come across are those that have been in the news for some rather unsavory dealings, so we won’t dwell on those too much – appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college’s satellite campus – a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentry beside the road, where students stroll in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people with bone fractures on the other. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily rotating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, performing cartwheels and twirls across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, glaring at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding politely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There’s a sushi place in a shopping mall beside the park that offers affordable food but never seems too busy – a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once – the beauty of a shopping mall. There’s also a frozen yogurt place there, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt topped with toppings while they perform stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana – a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "The first thing you should understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and pushes the boundaries of legality in at least half of these activities, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a plea to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it's an invitation - come to Portland, where being weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't mean acceptance of everything, but it does mean acceptance of things that are often not accepted. We're not devoid of modern conveniences or modern issues. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, but Portland has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Maybe weirdness just means we take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, you'll find colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. These are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They hold something magical, a treasure for the passerby, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes often contain clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among many. Some of my neighbors wouldn't dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Portland Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love many things. Portland is full of people who chase their dreams, or dream about chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug issues often stem from mental health problems, and the persistent rain and dreary clouds throughout much of the year don't help. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a problem that no one seems to know how to address. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, which are generally better than in most other parts of the country, but they are still insufficient. The non-homeless population oscillates between caring and hostility. In this, Portland is no different from other places.",
            "Die Berge sind immer da. Im Norden, sie bezeugen die Sonnenaufgänge und -untergänge jeden Morgen und jeden Abend. Egal, wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich in Arbeit und Leben aufgehen mag, sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unangestrengt und unberührt von den Herausforderungen des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich besonders gestresst und aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich zu ihnen schaue, lassen sie meine ängstliche Seele zur Ruhe kommen und geben mir die Kraft, weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich bin hierhergezogen, als ich mit meinem Studium begann, und die Berge im Norden des Campus haben mich sofort in ihren Bann gezogen. Natürlich hat die Universität auch ihre eigenen beeindruckenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die ebenfalls einen Teil meines Herzens beanspruchen, aber es sind die Berge, die den Thron innehaben. Der Rest der Stadt ist in seinen eigenen Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen ich viele Stunden mit kaffeegetriebenem Lernen verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus ein Stück weiter zur Innenstadt fahren und in eine Atmosphäre des Altertums eintauchen, die durch die verblassten bunten Ziegelsteine, die die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen, entsteht. Hier zeigt diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt genauso viel Hektik und Vitalität wie ihre städtische Nachbarschaft. Dies hält jedoch nicht lange an, da man erneut in die friedliche Kleinstadt fliehen kann, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbei geht. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in so naher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt ein wunderbares Vibe, als ob sie zu erkunden aufgerufen wird. So ist es leicht, viele wertvolle Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Egal ob es bedeutet, an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park nach einer durchwachsener Nacht mit Freunden vorbeizugehen oder durch die belebte Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film in dem luxuriösen Kino zu erwischen, für das die Universität Tickets bereitstellte. Leider ist es auch ein Heim für viele harte Erinnerungen, wie es in allen Orten in unserem Leben der Fall ist. Die Seen, insbesondere, können ein passender Ort zum Nachdenken und zum Weinen um zwei Uhr morgens während einer existentiellen Krise sein. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung. Während ich den Turtles und Enten und Insekten dabei zusehe, wie sie ihr Leben leben, jeder mit einer bestimmten Rolle, kann ich nicht anders, als über meinen eigenen Sinn und Zweck nachzudenken, während ich versuche, dieses Mysterium namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich an dem See vorbei und an dem Park und den kleinen Häusern, die von Suburbanität schreien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre brillanten Strahlen über die Palmen warf, den Himmel entlang malte und als ich nach oben sah, erkannte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Natürlich, sie waren da, wie immer. Die festen, überwältigenden Berge durchbohrten den nebeligen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, weckten sie in mir den Drang zum Durchhalten.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to slope downwards, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"workout hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workout. Since there aren't any sidewalks on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often take down the power lines, making the constant repairs look disjointed and patchwork-like. There are many tall evergreen trees all around; you can see them everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month, and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open, you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good-sized, and the gardeners hate them because they dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront, there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. Not many people move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people who live here. They usually keep to themselves, tending to their yards and daily chores. In winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live on the corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and recognize the cars that people drive. We take note of any unfamiliar vehicles. Some neighbors go for walks to exercise or to walk their dogs. Children bike around as you'd expect. We stay at home a lot since we work from home. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen. So, everyone here is used to us coming and going as well. We often play outside, even in the rain. We grill on our back deck occasionally, and the barbecue smell is always pleasant. Someone is always cutting grass here from March through October, the lawn mower hums nearly every day. The neighborhood was originally wooded and has plenty of trees, which means lots of shade but also leaves in the fall. So, we rake and burn the leaves annually. I like the smell of burning leaves, so it's a nice sign of fall. This year, we've had very little winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back, so we seldom use the front door unless someone knocks, which doesn't happen often. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage. With the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quite peaceful. Thanksgiving sees some neighbors visiting with out-of-town family, and there are extra cars parked during that time. The same goes for Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of always seeing brown, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a lot of money on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I suppose most places are changing the same way. Most of the time, the people are very friendly, but just like any city, you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people, so I guess it's a nice neighborhood. The stores in this area are pretty much the chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to experience upscale, you have to travel because I've never really seen any Whole Foods or stores like that. The most prominent jobs in my city, based on my observations, would be construction. I think this is because our city is still not very developed, and there's still a lot of open space to build. That kind of scares me, as I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, this was the field my full-time job is located in - I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs. As I'm writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can provide a unique experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville style. Drop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond are likely to be homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the people in my dormitory to be my community. Furthermore, I view the surrounding campus as a part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with more conventional ideas. Just like any conventional neighborhood, it has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's start with the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the houses, it's best to clarify the types of housing in my neighborhood. There are three main types: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory-style housing. In the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with 4-6 rooms per floor. Most buildings house around 20 people on average. Next, there are actual houses available to rent for those affiliated with the school. These are typically 2-4 bedroom apartments, often inhabited by alumni. However, these are less common, with only a few scattered throughout the neighborhood. Finally, there are the dormitory rooms, which house hundreds of students, with two people per room, and these are the most common type of housing in my neighborhood.\n\nWith housing covered, let's move on to the people. My school emphasizes diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and age groups living here. Most professional staff reside in houses within the neighborhood, while newer students live in dormitory-style housing, and older students in apartment-style housing. It's challenging to do justice to the people here with mere words, so let's move on to the stores and parks.\n\nSince my school essentially forms its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a variety of stores and a single park. The stores offer a mix of dining options found anywhere else, along with unique clothing and grocery stores. As a result, everything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries. Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse population, and it is kept clean and safe by all the residents.",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which I quite enjoy. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to without breaking the bank. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but offers decent service and drinks. Most people are friendly, either college students or lower-income residents, as the housing is quite affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, which is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, and I don't mind. They are quite fond of smoking weed, and the building management has installed an air freshener unit near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing. Most of the buildings are old and might have been recently renovated on the inside. Further down the street, there are brand-new apartment buildings, but I don't like them, as the construction quality is poor despite the expensive rent due to their proximity to campus. There's a budget restaurant about five minutes from my place that serves food on paper plates, mostly microwaved. Across the street is a gas station, known for not being a great place to work. However, the road was recently improved with city funds, adding sidewalks, grassy medians, and making the area nicer. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, with a few stumps where some were cut down, but there are more trees here than down the road. Behind my complex is another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind it, which is less appealing. The sidewalks there are in poor condition, and many buildings look rundown, with trees lining the street to hide the dilapidated buildings. Most crime in the area has occurred at an apartment complex on 43rd Street, but similar issues exist across the street from me as well. Despite it all, I like living here because I can afford it and there are plenty of amenities nearby, especially the university, which is within walking distance and has two bus stops for easy access to stores and downtown.",
            "My Nachbarschaft besteht aus Doppelhäusern auf einer Sackgasse. Sie sind abwechselnd und so platziert, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes gelb gestrichen, mit weißen Verandas und grünen Metalldächern ist. Fast jeder, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends am Ende eines nicht vorgegebenen Fahrweges und unterhalten uns, während die kleinen Kinder des Viertels mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, von Maschinen und Computern dominierten Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Zeitreise. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße Wolken betont werden. Der einzige Nachteil? Dieses Jahr erleben wir Tornadowarnungen, und gestern Abend haben wir zum ersten Mal echte Tornadosirenen gehört, sodass wir uns in Sicherheit gebracht haben. Natürlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, wo ich meinen kleinsten Hund in den Armen hielt, zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen. Mein größerer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, weil die Situation unheimlich war. Das Nachbarschaft war still, außer dem Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf den Boden fiel. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße förmlich, weil die Temperatur so schnell von 92 auf 75 fiel. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben schaute, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren genauso beeindruckt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben eine weitere Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wo immer sie gewesen waren, als das Unwetter losging. Dann ging das Leben wieder seinen gewohnten Gang. Mütter und Kinder spielten wieder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Solch ein freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Zweizimmerwohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, wie alle anderen auch. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Wohnungen drinnen nicht alle gleich. Einige sind sogar sehr klein. Es macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, am größten Feld hinter meinem Haus entlang zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Dort habe ich Rehe gesehen und morgens kann man den riesigen Frosch seine Melodie hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zum Leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb von Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man vom Krähen der Hühner aus den umliegenden Farmen geweckt. Es fühlt sich fast an wie in einem eigenen kleinen Dorf. Es gibt sogar einen Esel auf einem nahen Hof, der abends brayt, um uns wissen zu lassen, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, dieses Juwel einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.",
            "(German translation and retranslation)\n\nIch bin in dieses Viertel gezogen, kurz bevor ich mit der achten Klasse angefangen habe. Es war schwierig, Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich schließlich mit jemandem angefreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter wohnt, und einem anderen Jungen, der in meiner Straße lebt. Beide wohnen jetzt nicht mehr hier, aber die Erinnerungen sind geblieben. Die meisten Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, sind noch hier. Mein Viertel ähnelt einem durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Vorort. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser. An den Wochenenden oder wann immer es warm ist, höre ich die Kinder nach draußen spielen. Das Viertel ist tagsüber oft ruhig. Ich hatte noch nie ein Problem mit den Leuten hier. Sie lassen dich in Ruhe, es sei denn, du brauchst Hilfe. Ich habe online mehrfach Pakete bestellt und hatte noch nie ein Problem mit gestohlenen Paketen von meiner Veranda. Ich vertraue meinen Nachbarn. Es gibt einen Park, der nur ein paar Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt ist. Ich habe dort viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort mit anderen Jungs im Viertel Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Auch meine schlechteste Erinnerung stammt von dort, als ich mir beim Fußballspielen die Nase stoß, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen. Heute gehe ich dorthin, um Zeit mit meinen Cousins' Kindern zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und lieben es, auf Schaukeln und Rutschen zu spielen. Allein der Gedanke, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich sehr nostalgisch, aus verschiedenen Gründen. Das Viertel ist sehr vielseitig. In der Umgebung gibt es verschiedene Essensmöglichkeiten. Innerhalb eines Kilometerradius findest du chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heute nutzen viele Menschen Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensplätze sind die Fast-Food-Shops, aber die gibt es sowieso in fast jedem Vorort. Es gibt auch viele Pizza-Läden. Die Geschäfte hier bieten alles, was man je braucht. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungen in der Nähe. Es gibt eine Walgreens und eine CVS auf derselben Straße wie einen Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der in der Mitte des Landes beliebt ist. Einige Geschäfte sind auch vielseitig, wie ein von Indern geführter Laden, falls du mal indische Küche machen oder fertige indische Gerichte kaufen möchtest. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meines Viertels. Wenn ich auf Social Media lese und Nachrichten sehe, wie andere Menschen Horrorgeschichten über ihre Nachbarn erleben, bin ich dankbar für meine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from the others in South Carolina, but it's significant for the local agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, and the town proudly announces this on its welcoming sign. The town is primarily composed of farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses that are not in the town center are widely spaced and often two-story, with either metal roofs to withstand the hot summers or gray shingles. These houses are usually farther back from the road to allow for the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at an intersection, where all the town's stores are located. There are three places you can get fast food: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed down recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; they're famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also a small, expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it's the only grocery store in town, many people only stop by for a few items and prefer to shop at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for most of their groceries. The most popular store in town is Dollar General; it offers a wide range of everyday items and is always busy. There's a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman known in the community. The store has been around for many years and employs two movers for furniture deliveries. Attached to the furniture store is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering various services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located away from the town center; they're small but well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students attend middle and high school in the neighboring town once they finish fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being developed to provide more family outing opportunities and attract visitors. Despite the limited activities, it's a pleasant town, so small that you could pass through it without noticing.",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're three thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.",
            "The general area in which I live can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "**\n\nI live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, can be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill is this cool little arcade bar that draws all sorts of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you'll see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large for the area it's in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall staircases leading up. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it hard to stay warm. Being close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them warmer. They're also nearby the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historical buildings—the tall, proud structures, the architecture decorating the varying levels of the hills rolling down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once notorious for gang violence. You still hear stories about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through, trying to clean the streets. The people remember. Stories are passed down from generation to generation, even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, despite the neighborhood being considered one of the roughest in the city, to keep it clean. They still care about what happens in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night. This warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitterness of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's also aware of the reminders that plague our nation. No matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who've offered me a jacket more quickly and rarely nefariously than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open a few extra minutes so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to hide from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, feeling invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to get anywhere you need to go, but I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They are not cookie-cutter homes but older, updated and remodeled houses. Most homes have full basements that can be seen from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses in every color you can imagine in the blocks around my house. Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America with hard-working people who are either raising or have raised families. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can tell who fits in and who doesn't. You'll see someone grilling outside and wave or someone walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are well-maintained. There are no piles of leaves from fall. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed down. It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into thinking \"wow, look at the nice homes,\" but one you drive into thinking \"this would be a good place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it might not look exceptional, it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to end the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff's department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcer keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to the fields. You can be playing outside or inside and hear the sound of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you're really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It's a really great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Da ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Stadtteil extrem vielseitig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen kommerziellen Bereichen verteilt, wo eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben wird. Es gibt Büros, verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungseinrichtungen. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Läden, in denen man einkaufen kann. Einige Läden sind große, bekannte Marken, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, aber auch kleine Boutiquen werden immer beliebter. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in Gehdistanz zu Vierteln liegen, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass viele Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen angeht, so gibt es in meinem Stadtteil eine ziemliche Vielfalt. In einer kleinen Gegend gibt es eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein wenig außerhalb meines Stadtteils gibt es viele weitere Individuen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in eigene kleine Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgespalten sind. Es gibt Orte wie Korea-Town, China-Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch selbst ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein. Eine Fahrt von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders zur Rushhour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht zu Fuß. Während bestimmte interessante Orte in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zur Arbeit zu pendeln. Daher gibt es auch einigen der schlechtesten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren sehr viel Bauaktivität, da große Wohngebäude in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint eine beliebte Destination zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht über die Vorstellung, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge die Straßen füllen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohnungsgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Wohnungen und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, andere Duplexe. Dies gilt auch für meinen direkten Stadtteil, sodass es auch keine Mangel an verschiedenen Wohnmöglichkeiten gibt. Ähnlich wie beim Wohnen gibt es auch im Stadtteil Menschen verschiedener Altersgruppen, und ehrlich gesagt bin ich mit der Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn nicht vertraut. Es ist nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich mit meinem Nachbarn aus dem Haus nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Stadtteil spiele, die alle fast in meinem Alter waren.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but some have been split into two, remaining attached, if that makes sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like many others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this country, but it's now pulling away. But my neighborhood and many others still stand, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards aren't what they used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if the world around them is the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still evoking a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes may look different, but they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemeni family, who are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to let the cars pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of recent titles, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids, of course. There's a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "Du könntest es auf den ersten Blick übersehen - schließlich handelt es sich um ein Wohngebiet hinter Einkaufszeilen, nicht um einen Ort, an dem man Wohnmöglichkeiten erwarten würde. Zumindest nicht für die meisten Menschen. Aber wenn du hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods hindurchgehst und durch die Hotels, die nur während der Sommermonate von Familien zu Veranstaltungen bewohnt werden, findest du eine gesamte lebendige Gemeinschaft. Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, gibt es einige Apartmentkomplexe, die eng nebeneinander liegen wie russische Matrjoschen, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Reihe entlang der Straße wieder zusammengesetzt wurden. Die ersten Apartments, auf die du stößt, sind die, die in den Nachrichten zu beobachten waren, also werden wir diese nicht zu sehr ins Auge fassen - äußeres Erscheinungsbild kann täuschen. Aber die Apartments neben diesen Komplexen und die zwei Komplexe neben denen sind eine andere Welt, die fast niemand in dieser Gegend kennt. Gegenüber dieser Reihe gibt es einen Campus einer Gemeinschaftskollegestätte - eine ruhige, schläfrige Ansammlung von Gebäuden, die längs der Straße stehen, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hereinkommen, um ihre schläfrigen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore quietschen auf, um sie einzulassen, während Pendler aus dem Fenster grüßen und bei erhöhtem Andrang über die Verspätung schimpfen. Die Straße führt in eine weitere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einer Rehabilitationseinrichtung für Menschen, die durch unglückliche Umstände Knochenbrüche erlitten haben. Die Behandlungseinrichtung bietet fröhliche Terrassenmöbel und eine träge schwingende Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her wirbelt. Kinder laufen im Gras des Parks hin und her, drehen sich überschlagend und drehen sich um die spitzen grünen Stängel, während Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten entlang der Straße umherfliegen. Alte Rentner spazieren mit ihren Hunden auf dem Spazierweg, schimpfen über die Jugendlichen auf ihren Skateboards und nicken respektvoll an den jugendlichen Mädchen vorbei, die am Spielplatzgerät zusammenstehen und über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen tratschen. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das billige Speisen anbietet, aber nie allzu belebter scheint - ein Schwimmartikelgeschäft genau daneben und ein Nagelstudio dazwischen. Du könntest deinen Pool für die Saison füllen, während du eine Maniküre bekommst und Hibachi-Hähnchen isst - die Vorteile eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein Frozen Yogurt-Laden, einer der DIY-Typen, und oft sieht man die Jugendlichen im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Frozen Yogurt-Bechern in den Händen, die mit Dekorationen belegt sind, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Stunts machen und dampfen, weil sie es für das Coolste halten. Das in Frage stehende Viertel ist ein Stück Amerika - ein Stück Geschichte im schläfrigen Süden, wo sich kaum etwas verändert, nicht einmal die Zeit.",
            "Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be shocked at the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space in her life. Taken aback by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past, he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Den ersten Punkt, den man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"weird\". Der unoffizielle Stadtslogan, der auf einem Gebäude steht, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikveranstaltungsort, Stripclub und teilweise gegen das Gesetz verstößt, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist das ein Aufruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und günstiger war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es eine Einladung: Kommt nach Portland, wo man euch noch als weird bezeichnet, aber als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des endlosen Condominiumbaus für diese Kalifornier bleibt Portland weird. Weird bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Weird bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und Kämpfe haben. Wie das restliche Land kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt Millionen von Möglichkeiten, weird zu sein und nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normales. Portland hat Yoga und Hipster und Geschäftsprofis. Vielleicht bedeutet weird, dass wir einfach all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Nachbarschaften, haben wir farbenfrohe Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Diese Kisten sind normalerweise aus Pappe und enthalten Dinge, die jemand loswerden will, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein perfektes Geschenk für jemanden, der vorbeigeht, oft mehr als überraschend. Diese Kisten enthalten normalerweise Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles mögliche enthalten. Das Magische daran, durch eine Südost-Portland-Nachbarschaft zu schlendern, ist es, was Portland für mich ausmacht. Das bedeutet, was Portland für mich ausmacht, aber ich bin nur eine von abertausenden verschiedenen Arten von weird. Einige Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden nie Kleider aus einer Kiste an der Straße auswählen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (der städtische Fußballclub). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder davon träumen, Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben normalerweise (in ihrer Ursache) mit psychischen Problemen zu tun, und der ständige Regen und die trüben Wolken scheinen dazu beizutragen. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, für das niemand eine Lösung weiß. Die Obdachlosen werden von den sozialen Dienstleistungen angezogen, die Portland besser als die meisten Teile des Landes bietet, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind unzureichend, wie es in allen Teilen des Landes der Fall ist. Die Bevölkerung, die nicht obdachlos ist, schwankt zwischen Mitgefühl und Hass. In diesem Punkt sind wir nicht weird.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they witness the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how engrossed I am in work and life, they remain steadfast, unyielding, and unperturbed by life's challenges. On days when I am most stressed and overwhelmed, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they allow me to find solace for my anxious soul, lending me the strength to endure, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also hold a piece of my heart, but it is the mountains that truly hold sway. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an atmosphere of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as its neighboring urban city. This doesn't last for many blocks, however, as one can quickly escape back to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such close proximity truly gives this city a wondrous vibe, as if it is inviting exploration. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects living out their lives, each with their own role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The strong, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workout. Since there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines, and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-like. There are many tall evergreen trees all around wherever you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "Ich lebe in einer typischen Vorortsiedlung in einer kleinen südlichen Stadt in Tennessee. Es ist eine Verbindungsstraße zwischen zwei Staatsstraßen, sodass wir etwas mehr Verkehr auf der Straße haben, als ich möchte, aber abgesehen davon ist es eine ruhige Nachbarschaft. Es gibt nicht viele Leute, die hier ein- und ausziehen, sodass ich die majority of the people, die in der Nachbarschaft leben, kenne. Die Menschen beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Aufgaben. Im Winter fahren wir mit Schlitten einen Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße hinab. Wir wohnen in einem Haus an der Ecke unserer Straße, sodass wir jeden Menschen sehen, der kommt und geht, und die Autos, die hier fahren, kennen. Wenn wir ein unbekanntes Fahrzeug sehen, notieren wir es uns. Einige der Nachbarn gehen zum Spazierengehen oder um ihre Hunde auszuführen. Kinder spielen auf ihren Fahrrädern und das Ganze, was man von einer solchen Nachbarschaft erwarten würde. Wir sind die meiste Zeit zu Hause, da wir von unserem Haus aus arbeiten. Es gibt vier von uns: mich selbst, meine Frau und zwei Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn Jahren. Also, ich würde sagen, dass alle anderen es gewohnt sind, uns zu sehen. Wir gehen nach draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir auch auf unserer hinteren Terrasse und es ist immer ein angenehmer Geruch vom Grill. Es scheint immer jemand zu sein, der Rasen mäht, und man hört fast jeden Tag von März bis etwa Oktober, wenn das Gras schließlich aufhört zu wachsen. In unserer Nachbarschaft gibt es viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, sodass es viele Schatten gibt, aber es gibt auch immer viele Blätter im Herbst. Das bedeutet, dass wir jedes Jahr Blätter fegen und verbrennen müssen. Ich mag den Geruch von verbrannten Blättern und das ist immer ein Zeichen, dass der Herbst gekommen ist. In letzter Zeit haben wir nicht viel Winter gehabt, sodass es sich nur wie ein langer Herbst anfühlt. Unsere Garage befindet sich hinten im Haus, sodass wir die Vordertür unseres Hauses nur verwenden, wenn jemand anklopft, was selten vorkommt. Ich mag es, in der Garage an meinem Truck oder anderen Projekten zu arbeiten und wenn ich die Garagentore offen habe, fühle ich mich mehr mit der Nachbarschaft verbunden. An Feiertagen ist es hier recht ruhig. Thanksgiving sieht einige der Familien in unserer Nachbarschaft, die mit Leuten aus der Ferne zu Besuch sind und es gibt extra geparkte Autos während dieser Zeit des Jahres. Das ist auch bei anderen Feiertagen wie Muttertag und Weihnachten so. Insgesamt gefällt es mir hier zu leben. Wenn es nicht eine Durchgangsstraße wäre, wäre es perfekt.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the middle of the high desert, where there's just dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of seeing brown all the time, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I think that's how most places are changing. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people and I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic, you have to travel, I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, there's still a lot of open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they're all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I'm writing this now they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the people living in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people per room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. The actual houses available for anyone with an affiliation to the school are typically 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory-style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school is really its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the school's own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!",
            "Well, since I've been here for about 10 years, I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived right next to us. They were enjoyable people that I almost consider as family, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (he got remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Mrs. Veda, took off the little white strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, it’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad and my best friend were raised by Mr. Graves in tennis, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "Meine Nachbarschaft besteht aus Duplexen, die entlang einer Sackgasse gebaut sind. Sie sind unregelmäßig platziert und beabstandet, sodass sie wie individuelle Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass sie alle gelb gestrichen sind, mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends oft am Ende eines nicht vorgegebenen Zufahrtsweges und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, technisch/mechanisch/füllenden Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Zeitreise. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die von einem blauen Himmel und weißen Wolken überzogen sind. Der einzige Nachteil? In dieser Saison erleben wir Tornadowarnungen und gestern Abend hörten wir tatsächlich Tornadosirenen, sodass wir Zuflucht suchen mussten. Tatsächlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, die ich mit meinem kleinsten Hund, meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen ausfüllte. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, nervös wegen der merkwürdigen Situation. Die Nachbarschaft war still, bis auf das Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf dem Boden niederging. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße wörtlich, weil die Temperatur von 92 auf 75 Grad fiel. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben sah, klarte der Himmel auf und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren genauso beeindruckt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde still, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wo sie sich befanden, als der Gewittersturm losging. Dann war wieder alles wie zuvor, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Das ist eine sehr freundliche Nachbarschaft für eine Frau, die vor Kurzem aus NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe die southern Akzente, die die Menschen sprechen. Ich habe eine Zwei-Zimmer-Wohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, wie fast alle. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Apartments im Inneren nicht alle gleich. Einige sind überraschend klein. Das macht für mich keinen Sinn. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen geeignet ist. Dort habe ich Hirsche gesehen und morgens kann man den Gesang der großen Frosch hören. Es ist ein wunderbarer Ort zum Leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird der Tag vom Krähen der Hähne von den umliegenden Farmen begrüßt. Es ist fast wie in einem kleinen Dorf zu leben. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einem nahen Hof, den man abends brayen hört und so wissen wir, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, diesen Juwel von einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard initially, but I eventually became close to someone who lives two houses down and another guy who lives on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but the memories remain. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is quite similar to an average American suburban neighborhood. It has a lot of two-story houses. On warm weekends or whenever it's warm outside, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. You're pretty much left alone here unless you need help. I've ordered numerous online packages and never had one snatched from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a few minutes' walk from my house. I have many memories there, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good memories far outweigh the bad. Now, when I go to the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. The thought of going to the park excites them. The park brings back many nostalgic feelings for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse. Nearby, you can find all sorts of food, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food shops are common, but they're usually found in any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are even owned by Indians if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood. Seeing and reading about the horror stories some people have with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from other towns in South Carolina, but it significantly impacts the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside of the town center are spread far apart; most are two-story homes with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's only stores are located. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery store. Most residents prefer to shop at Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, selling a wide range of everyday items and often busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-known woman who employs two movers for deliveries. Attached to the store is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being created to provide more opportunities for outings and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a pleasant town, so small that one might easily pass through without noticing.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who had gone missing. It was quite surprising. Virtually every apartment in the area rented for more than a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard anything like this, neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Everything is expensive, but we've learned to be frugal over the years. You get used to the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You notice less smell as you get older. You might start smoking, or you might just become accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market is always there. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It lingers in the leather and stays even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can also visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you won't hear any of it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep your distance as long as you like, and the city will pass by like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to live. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we live among less strangers and more friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me very well. I make sure to keep things clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I even bring them mail, and they bring me theirs. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I didn't ruin my life after all.",
            "The general area I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is situated just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, can be described as the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by individuals with low income. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but they are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime, except for an occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been significantly impacted by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "Ich lebe in ländlicher America, genauer gesagt in einer kleinen Stadt in Michigan. Von Farmland zu kleinen touristischen Städten; keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Walmart, Target oder sogar ein Applebees. Alles, was du brauchst, musst du mit dem Auto erreichen. Trotz allem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Das schöne Lake Michigan liegt auf einer Seite, und auf der anderen Seite das Lake Charlevoix. Überall, wohin du gehst, findest du einen Strand, um deine Füße einzutauchen. Mein Wohnviertel spiegelt den Geist einer kleinen Stadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht aufeinander gestapelt. Es sind keine gleichartigen Fertighäuser; sie sind older Homes, einige renoviert und modernisiert, andere älter. Viele Häuser haben Kellerräume, die von der Straße aus visiblesind. Viele Häuser im Viertel haben ältere Aluminiumfassaden. In den Blöcken um mein Haus herum gibt es Häuser in jeder erdenklichen Farbe. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten, Trampoline und Spielgeräte. Einige haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem klassischen amerikanischen Stil. Es sind hart arbeitende Menschen, die versuchen, ein Einkommen zu erzielen und entweder Familien aufziehen oder sie bereits großgezogen haben. Jeden Tag sieht man Kinder auf und ab die Straße entlang laufen. Man sieht auch Menschen, die ihre Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren und Rollerbladen. Nachbarn kennen sich und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden, der draußen grillt und winkt, oder jemand, der seinen Hund ein paar Blocks weiter ausführt und nett grüßt. Die Rasen sind in gutem Zustand. Niemand hat Blätter aus dem Herbst, die sich stapeln. Das Gras wird gemäht und ist unter Kontrolle. Wenn die Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind sie gestutzt. Es ist kein schöner Stadtteil, in den man fährt und denkt, wow, schöne Häuser, sondern einer, in den man fährt und denkt, hier könnte man eine Familie aufziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es sich nur um einen durchschnittlichen Stadtteil handelt, ist er besonders, weil er das wünscht, was die Menschen in der Welt suchen: einen sicheren Ort, an den sie am Ende des Tages zurückkehren können. Innerhalb weniger Gehminuten erreicht man das County Sheriff's Department und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt ist direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum liegt nur ein paar Straßen weiter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner der Stadt nutzen die Dienstleistungen, die sie anbieten. Es gibt Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, auf denen man die Ansager hören kann, die die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler rufen. Unser kleines Stadtflughafen liegt direkt daneben, und man kann draußen spielen oder drinnen sein und das Brummen kleiner Flugzeuge beim Starten und Landen hören. Man kann zu Fuß Eiscreme bei dem local Ice Cream Place kaufen, und wenn man es wirklich möchte, kann man mit dem Fahrrad in die Innenstadt fahren, die nur 8 Blocks von unserem Wohnviertel entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich guter Ort, um zu leben."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Da ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Stadtteil extrem vielseitig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen kommerziellen Bereichen verteilt, wo eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben wird. Es gibt Büros, verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungseinrichtungen. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Läden, in denen man einkaufen kann. Einige Läden sind große, bekannte Marken, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, aber auch kleine Boutiquen werden immer beliebter. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in Gehdistanz zu Vierteln liegen, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass viele Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen angeht, so gibt es in meinem Stadtteil eine ziemliche Vielfalt. In einer kleinen Gegend gibt es eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein wenig außerhalb meines Stadtteils gibt es viele weitere Individuen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in eigene kleine Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgespalten sind. Es gibt Orte wie Korea-Town, China-Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch selbst ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein. Eine Fahrt von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders zur Rushhour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht zu Fuß. Während bestimmte interessante Orte in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zur Arbeit zu pendeln. Daher gibt es auch einigen der schlechtesten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren sehr viel Bauaktivität, da große Wohngebäude in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint eine beliebte Destination zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht über die Vorstellung, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge die Straßen füllen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohnungsgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Wohnungen und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, andere Duplexe. Dies gilt auch für meinen direkten Stadtteil, sodass es auch keine Mangel an verschiedenen Wohnmöglichkeiten gibt. Ähnlich wie beim Wohnen gibt es auch im Stadtteil Menschen verschiedener Altersgruppen, und ehrlich gesagt bin ich mit der Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn nicht vertraut. Es ist nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich mit meinem Nachbarn aus dem Haus nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Stadtteil spiele, die alle fast in meinem Alter waren.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but some have been split into two, remaining attached, if that makes sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like many others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this country, but it's now pulling away. But my neighborhood and many others still stand, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards aren't what they used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if the world around them is the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still evoking a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes may look different, but they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemeni family, who are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to let the cars pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of recent titles, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids, of course. There's a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "Du könntest es auf den ersten Blick übersehen - schließlich handelt es sich um ein Wohngebiet hinter Einkaufszeilen, nicht um einen Ort, an dem man Wohnmöglichkeiten erwarten würde. Zumindest nicht für die meisten Menschen. Aber wenn du hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods hindurchgehst und durch die Hotels, die nur während der Sommermonate von Familien zu Veranstaltungen bewohnt werden, findest du eine gesamte lebendige Gemeinschaft. Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, gibt es einige Apartmentkomplexe, die eng nebeneinander liegen wie russische Matrjoschen, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Reihe entlang der Straße wieder zusammengesetzt wurden. Die ersten Apartments, auf die du stößt, sind die, die in den Nachrichten zu beobachten waren, also werden wir diese nicht zu sehr ins Auge fassen - äußeres Erscheinungsbild kann täuschen. Aber die Apartments neben diesen Komplexen und die zwei Komplexe neben denen sind eine andere Welt, die fast niemand in dieser Gegend kennt. Gegenüber dieser Reihe gibt es einen Campus einer Gemeinschaftskollegestätte - eine ruhige, schläfrige Ansammlung von Gebäuden, die längs der Straße stehen, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hereinkommen, um ihre schläfrigen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore quietschen auf, um sie einzulassen, während Pendler aus dem Fenster grüßen und bei erhöhtem Andrang über die Verspätung schimpfen. Die Straße führt in eine weitere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einer Rehabilitationseinrichtung für Menschen, die durch unglückliche Umstände Knochenbrüche erlitten haben. Die Behandlungseinrichtung bietet fröhliche Terrassenmöbel und eine träge schwingende Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her wirbelt. Kinder laufen im Gras des Parks hin und her, drehen sich überschlagend und drehen sich um die spitzen grünen Stängel, während Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten entlang der Straße umherfliegen. Alte Rentner spazieren mit ihren Hunden auf dem Spazierweg, schimpfen über die Jugendlichen auf ihren Skateboards und nicken respektvoll an den jugendlichen Mädchen vorbei, die am Spielplatzgerät zusammenstehen und über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen tratschen. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das billige Speisen anbietet, aber nie allzu belebter scheint - ein Schwimmartikelgeschäft genau daneben und ein Nagelstudio dazwischen. Du könntest deinen Pool für die Saison füllen, während du eine Maniküre bekommst und Hibachi-Hähnchen isst - die Vorteile eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein Frozen Yogurt-Laden, einer der DIY-Typen, und oft sieht man die Jugendlichen im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Frozen Yogurt-Bechern in den Händen, die mit Dekorationen belegt sind, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Stunts machen und dampfen, weil sie es für das Coolste halten. Das in Frage stehende Viertel ist ein Stück Amerika - ein Stück Geschichte im schläfrigen Süden, wo sich kaum etwas verändert, nicht einmal die Zeit.",
            "Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be shocked at the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space in her life. Taken aback by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past, he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Den ersten Punkt, den man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"weird\". Der unoffizielle Stadtslogan, der auf einem Gebäude steht, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikveranstaltungsort, Stripclub und teilweise gegen das Gesetz verstößt, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist das ein Aufruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und günstiger war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es eine Einladung: Kommt nach Portland, wo man euch noch als weird bezeichnet, aber als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des endlosen Condominiumbaus für diese Kalifornier bleibt Portland weird. Weird bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Weird bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und Kämpfe haben. Wie das restliche Land kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt Millionen von Möglichkeiten, weird zu sein und nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normales. Portland hat Yoga und Hipster und Geschäftsprofis. Vielleicht bedeutet weird, dass wir einfach all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Nachbarschaften, haben wir farbenfrohe Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Diese Kisten sind normalerweise aus Pappe und enthalten Dinge, die jemand loswerden will, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein perfektes Geschenk für jemanden, der vorbeigeht, oft mehr als überraschend. Diese Kisten enthalten normalerweise Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles mögliche enthalten. Das Magische daran, durch eine Südost-Portland-Nachbarschaft zu schlendern, ist es, was Portland für mich ausmacht. Das bedeutet, was Portland für mich ausmacht, aber ich bin nur eine von abertausenden verschiedenen Arten von weird. Einige Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden nie Kleider aus einer Kiste an der Straße auswählen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (der städtische Fußballclub). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder davon träumen, Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben normalerweise (in ihrer Ursache) mit psychischen Problemen zu tun, und der ständige Regen und die trüben Wolken scheinen dazu beizutragen. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, für das niemand eine Lösung weiß. Die Obdachlosen werden von den sozialen Dienstleistungen angezogen, die Portland besser als die meisten Teile des Landes bietet, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind unzureichend, wie es in allen Teilen des Landes der Fall ist. Die Bevölkerung, die nicht obdachlos ist, schwankt zwischen Mitgefühl und Hass. In diesem Punkt sind wir nicht weird.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they witness the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how engrossed I am in work and life, they remain steadfast, unyielding, and unperturbed by life's challenges. On days when I am most stressed and overwhelmed, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they allow me to find solace for my anxious soul, lending me the strength to endure, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also hold a piece of my heart, but it is the mountains that truly hold sway. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an atmosphere of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as its neighboring urban city. This doesn't last for many blocks, however, as one can quickly escape back to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such close proximity truly gives this city a wondrous vibe, as if it is inviting exploration. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects living out their lives, each with their own role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The strong, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workout. Since there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines, and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-like. There are many tall evergreen trees all around wherever you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "Ich lebe in einer typischen Vorortsiedlung in einer kleinen südlichen Stadt in Tennessee. Es ist eine Verbindungsstraße zwischen zwei Staatsstraßen, sodass wir etwas mehr Verkehr auf der Straße haben, als ich möchte, aber abgesehen davon ist es eine ruhige Nachbarschaft. Es gibt nicht viele Leute, die hier ein- und ausziehen, sodass ich die majority of the people, die in der Nachbarschaft leben, kenne. Die Menschen beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Aufgaben. Im Winter fahren wir mit Schlitten einen Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße hinab. Wir wohnen in einem Haus an der Ecke unserer Straße, sodass wir jeden Menschen sehen, der kommt und geht, und die Autos, die hier fahren, kennen. Wenn wir ein unbekanntes Fahrzeug sehen, notieren wir es uns. Einige der Nachbarn gehen zum Spazierengehen oder um ihre Hunde auszuführen. Kinder spielen auf ihren Fahrrädern und das Ganze, was man von einer solchen Nachbarschaft erwarten würde. Wir sind die meiste Zeit zu Hause, da wir von unserem Haus aus arbeiten. Es gibt vier von uns: mich selbst, meine Frau und zwei Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn Jahren. Also, ich würde sagen, dass alle anderen es gewohnt sind, uns zu sehen. Wir gehen nach draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir auch auf unserer hinteren Terrasse und es ist immer ein angenehmer Geruch vom Grill. Es scheint immer jemand zu sein, der Rasen mäht, und man hört fast jeden Tag von März bis etwa Oktober, wenn das Gras schließlich aufhört zu wachsen. In unserer Nachbarschaft gibt es viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, sodass es viele Schatten gibt, aber es gibt auch immer viele Blätter im Herbst. Das bedeutet, dass wir jedes Jahr Blätter fegen und verbrennen müssen. Ich mag den Geruch von verbrannten Blättern und das ist immer ein Zeichen, dass der Herbst gekommen ist. In letzter Zeit haben wir nicht viel Winter gehabt, sodass es sich nur wie ein langer Herbst anfühlt. Unsere Garage befindet sich hinten im Haus, sodass wir die Vordertür unseres Hauses nur verwenden, wenn jemand anklopft, was selten vorkommt. Ich mag es, in der Garage an meinem Truck oder anderen Projekten zu arbeiten und wenn ich die Garagentore offen habe, fühle ich mich mehr mit der Nachbarschaft verbunden. An Feiertagen ist es hier recht ruhig. Thanksgiving sieht einige der Familien in unserer Nachbarschaft, die mit Leuten aus der Ferne zu Besuch sind und es gibt extra geparkte Autos während dieser Zeit des Jahres. Das ist auch bei anderen Feiertagen wie Muttertag und Weihnachten so. Insgesamt gefällt es mir hier zu leben. Wenn es nicht eine Durchgangsstraße wäre, wäre es perfekt.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the middle of the high desert, where there's just dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of seeing brown all the time, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I think that's how most places are changing. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people and I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic, you have to travel, I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, there's still a lot of open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they're all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I'm writing this now they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the people living in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people per room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. The actual houses available for anyone with an affiliation to the school are typically 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory-style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school is really its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the school's own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!",
            "Well, since I've been here for about 10 years, I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived right next to us. They were enjoyable people that I almost consider as family, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (he got remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Mrs. Veda, took off the little white strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, it’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad and my best friend were raised by Mr. Graves in tennis, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "Meine Nachbarschaft besteht aus Duplexen, die entlang einer Sackgasse gebaut sind. Sie sind unregelmäßig platziert und beabstandet, sodass sie wie individuelle Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass sie alle gelb gestrichen sind, mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends oft am Ende eines nicht vorgegebenen Zufahrtsweges und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, technisch/mechanisch/füllenden Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Zeitreise. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die von einem blauen Himmel und weißen Wolken überzogen sind. Der einzige Nachteil? In dieser Saison erleben wir Tornadowarnungen und gestern Abend hörten wir tatsächlich Tornadosirenen, sodass wir Zuflucht suchen mussten. Tatsächlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, die ich mit meinem kleinsten Hund, meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen ausfüllte. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, nervös wegen der merkwürdigen Situation. Die Nachbarschaft war still, bis auf das Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf dem Boden niederging. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße wörtlich, weil die Temperatur von 92 auf 75 Grad fiel. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben sah, klarte der Himmel auf und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren genauso beeindruckt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde still, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wo sie sich befanden, als der Gewittersturm losging. Dann war wieder alles wie zuvor, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Das ist eine sehr freundliche Nachbarschaft für eine Frau, die vor Kurzem aus NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe die southern Akzente, die die Menschen sprechen. Ich habe eine Zwei-Zimmer-Wohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, wie fast alle. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Apartments im Inneren nicht alle gleich. Einige sind überraschend klein. Das macht für mich keinen Sinn. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen geeignet ist. Dort habe ich Hirsche gesehen und morgens kann man den Gesang der großen Frosch hören. Es ist ein wunderbarer Ort zum Leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird der Tag vom Krähen der Hähne von den umliegenden Farmen begrüßt. Es ist fast wie in einem kleinen Dorf zu leben. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einem nahen Hof, den man abends brayen hört und so wissen wir, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, diesen Juwel von einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard initially, but I eventually became close to someone who lives two houses down and another guy who lives on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but the memories remain. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is quite similar to an average American suburban neighborhood. It has a lot of two-story houses. On warm weekends or whenever it's warm outside, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. You're pretty much left alone here unless you need help. I've ordered numerous online packages and never had one snatched from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a few minutes' walk from my house. I have many memories there, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good memories far outweigh the bad. Now, when I go to the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. The thought of going to the park excites them. The park brings back many nostalgic feelings for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse. Nearby, you can find all sorts of food, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food shops are common, but they're usually found in any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are even owned by Indians if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood. Seeing and reading about the horror stories some people have with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from other towns in South Carolina, but it significantly impacts the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside of the town center are spread far apart; most are two-story homes with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's only stores are located. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery store. Most residents prefer to shop at Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, selling a wide range of everyday items and often busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-known woman who employs two movers for deliveries. Attached to the store is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being created to provide more opportunities for outings and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a pleasant town, so small that one might easily pass through without noticing.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who had gone missing. It was quite surprising. Virtually every apartment in the area rented for more than a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard anything like this, neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Everything is expensive, but we've learned to be frugal over the years. You get used to the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You notice less smell as you get older. You might start smoking, or you might just become accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market is always there. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It lingers in the leather and stays even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can also visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you won't hear any of it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep your distance as long as you like, and the city will pass by like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to live. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we live among less strangers and more friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me very well. I make sure to keep things clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I even bring them mail, and they bring me theirs. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I didn't ruin my life after all.",
            "The general area I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is situated just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, can be described as the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by individuals with low income. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but they are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime, except for an occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been significantly impacted by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "Ich lebe in ländlicher America, genauer gesagt in einer kleinen Stadt in Michigan. Von Farmland zu kleinen touristischen Städten; keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Walmart, Target oder sogar ein Applebees. Alles, was du brauchst, musst du mit dem Auto erreichen. Trotz allem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Das schöne Lake Michigan liegt auf einer Seite, und auf der anderen Seite das Lake Charlevoix. Überall, wohin du gehst, findest du einen Strand, um deine Füße einzutauchen. Mein Wohnviertel spiegelt den Geist einer kleinen Stadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht aufeinander gestapelt. Es sind keine gleichartigen Fertighäuser; sie sind older Homes, einige renoviert und modernisiert, andere älter. Viele Häuser haben Kellerräume, die von der Straße aus visiblesind. Viele Häuser im Viertel haben ältere Aluminiumfassaden. In den Blöcken um mein Haus herum gibt es Häuser in jeder erdenklichen Farbe. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten, Trampoline und Spielgeräte. Einige haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem klassischen amerikanischen Stil. Es sind hart arbeitende Menschen, die versuchen, ein Einkommen zu erzielen und entweder Familien aufziehen oder sie bereits großgezogen haben. Jeden Tag sieht man Kinder auf und ab die Straße entlang laufen. Man sieht auch Menschen, die ihre Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren und Rollerbladen. Nachbarn kennen sich und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden, der draußen grillt und winkt, oder jemand, der seinen Hund ein paar Blocks weiter ausführt und nett grüßt. Die Rasen sind in gutem Zustand. Niemand hat Blätter aus dem Herbst, die sich stapeln. Das Gras wird gemäht und ist unter Kontrolle. Wenn die Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind sie gestutzt. Es ist kein schöner Stadtteil, in den man fährt und denkt, wow, schöne Häuser, sondern einer, in den man fährt und denkt, hier könnte man eine Familie aufziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es sich nur um einen durchschnittlichen Stadtteil handelt, ist er besonders, weil er das wünscht, was die Menschen in der Welt suchen: einen sicheren Ort, an den sie am Ende des Tages zurückkehren können. Innerhalb weniger Gehminuten erreicht man das County Sheriff's Department und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt ist direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum liegt nur ein paar Straßen weiter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner der Stadt nutzen die Dienstleistungen, die sie anbieten. Es gibt Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, auf denen man die Ansager hören kann, die die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler rufen. Unser kleines Stadtflughafen liegt direkt daneben, und man kann draußen spielen oder drinnen sein und das Brummen kleiner Flugzeuge beim Starten und Landen hören. Man kann zu Fuß Eiscreme bei dem local Ice Cream Place kaufen, und wenn man es wirklich möchte, kann man mit dem Fahrrad in die Innenstadt fahren, die nur 8 Blocks von unserem Wohnviertel entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich guter Ort, um zu leben."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "Da ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Stadtteil extrem vielseitig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen kommerziellen Bereichen verteilt, wo eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben wird. Es gibt Büros, verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungseinrichtungen. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Läden, in denen man einkaufen kann. Einige Läden sind große, bekannte Marken, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, aber auch kleine Boutiquen werden immer beliebter. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in Gehdistanz zu Vierteln liegen, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass viele Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen angeht, so gibt es in meinem Stadtteil eine ziemliche Vielfalt. In einer kleinen Gegend gibt es eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein wenig außerhalb meines Stadtteils gibt es viele weitere Individuen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in eigene kleine Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgespalten sind. Es gibt Orte wie Korea-Town, China-Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch selbst ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein. Eine Fahrt von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders zur Rushhour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht zu Fuß. Während bestimmte interessante Orte in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zur Arbeit zu pendeln. Daher gibt es auch einigen der schlechtesten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren sehr viel Bauaktivität, da große Wohngebäude in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint eine beliebte Destination zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht über die Vorstellung, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge die Straßen füllen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohnungsgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Wohnungen und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, andere Duplexe. Dies gilt auch für meinen direkten Stadtteil, sodass es auch keine Mangel an verschiedenen Wohnmöglichkeiten gibt. Ähnlich wie beim Wohnen gibt es auch im Stadtteil Menschen verschiedener Altersgruppen, und ehrlich gesagt bin ich mit der Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn nicht vertraut. Es ist nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich mit meinem Nachbarn aus dem Haus nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Stadtteil spiele, die alle fast in meinem Alter waren.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but some have been split into two, remaining attached, if that makes sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like many others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream once embraced the people of this country, but it's now pulling away. But my neighborhood and many others still stand, still calling out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optimistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards aren't what they used to be, but there's still a car or two in every driveway, and the youth play as if the world around them is the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still evoking a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes may look different, but they feel the same. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemeni family, who are probably the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play football, only stopping to let the cars pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of recent titles, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids, of course. There's a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we are trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be the best representation of my town.",
            "Du könntest es auf den ersten Blick übersehen - schließlich handelt es sich um ein Wohngebiet hinter Einkaufszeilen, nicht um einen Ort, an dem man Wohnmöglichkeiten erwarten würde. Zumindest nicht für die meisten Menschen. Aber wenn du hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods hindurchgehst und durch die Hotels, die nur während der Sommermonate von Familien zu Veranstaltungen bewohnt werden, findest du eine gesamte lebendige Gemeinschaft. Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, gibt es einige Apartmentkomplexe, die eng nebeneinander liegen wie russische Matrjoschen, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Reihe entlang der Straße wieder zusammengesetzt wurden. Die ersten Apartments, auf die du stößt, sind die, die in den Nachrichten zu beobachten waren, also werden wir diese nicht zu sehr ins Auge fassen - äußeres Erscheinungsbild kann täuschen. Aber die Apartments neben diesen Komplexen und die zwei Komplexe neben denen sind eine andere Welt, die fast niemand in dieser Gegend kennt. Gegenüber dieser Reihe gibt es einen Campus einer Gemeinschaftskollegestätte - eine ruhige, schläfrige Ansammlung von Gebäuden, die längs der Straße stehen, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hereinkommen, um ihre schläfrigen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore quietschen auf, um sie einzulassen, während Pendler aus dem Fenster grüßen und bei erhöhtem Andrang über die Verspätung schimpfen. Die Straße führt in eine weitere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einer Rehabilitationseinrichtung für Menschen, die durch unglückliche Umstände Knochenbrüche erlitten haben. Die Behandlungseinrichtung bietet fröhliche Terrassenmöbel und eine träge schwingende Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her wirbelt. Kinder laufen im Gras des Parks hin und her, drehen sich überschlagend und drehen sich um die spitzen grünen Stängel, während Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten entlang der Straße umherfliegen. Alte Rentner spazieren mit ihren Hunden auf dem Spazierweg, schimpfen über die Jugendlichen auf ihren Skateboards und nicken respektvoll an den jugendlichen Mädchen vorbei, die am Spielplatzgerät zusammenstehen und über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen tratschen. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das billige Speisen anbietet, aber nie allzu belebter scheint - ein Schwimmartikelgeschäft genau daneben und ein Nagelstudio dazwischen. Du könntest deinen Pool für die Saison füllen, während du eine Maniküre bekommst und Hibachi-Hähnchen isst - die Vorteile eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein Frozen Yogurt-Laden, einer der DIY-Typen, und oft sieht man die Jugendlichen im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Frozen Yogurt-Bechern in den Händen, die mit Dekorationen belegt sind, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Stunts machen und dampfen, weil sie es für das Coolste halten. Das in Frage stehende Viertel ist ein Stück Amerika - ein Stück Geschichte im schläfrigen Süden, wo sich kaum etwas verändert, nicht einmal die Zeit.",
            "Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be shocked at the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space in her life. Taken aback by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past, he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.",
            "Den ersten Punkt, den man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"weird\". Der unoffizielle Stadtslogan, der auf einem Gebäude steht, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikveranstaltungsort, Stripclub und teilweise gegen das Gesetz verstößt, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist das ein Aufruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und günstiger war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es eine Einladung: Kommt nach Portland, wo man euch noch als weird bezeichnet, aber als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des endlosen Condominiumbaus für diese Kalifornier bleibt Portland weird. Weird bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Weird bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und Kämpfe haben. Wie das restliche Land kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt Millionen von Möglichkeiten, weird zu sein und nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normales. Portland hat Yoga und Hipster und Geschäftsprofis. Vielleicht bedeutet weird, dass wir einfach all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Nachbarschaften, haben wir farbenfrohe Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Diese Kisten sind normalerweise aus Pappe und enthalten Dinge, die jemand loswerden will, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein perfektes Geschenk für jemanden, der vorbeigeht, oft mehr als überraschend. Diese Kisten enthalten normalerweise Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles mögliche enthalten. Das Magische daran, durch eine Südost-Portland-Nachbarschaft zu schlendern, ist es, was Portland für mich ausmacht. Das bedeutet, was Portland für mich ausmacht, aber ich bin nur eine von abertausenden verschiedenen Arten von weird. Einige Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden nie Kleider aus einer Kiste an der Straße auswählen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (der städtische Fußballclub). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder davon träumen, Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben normalerweise (in ihrer Ursache) mit psychischen Problemen zu tun, und der ständige Regen und die trüben Wolken scheinen dazu beizutragen. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, für das niemand eine Lösung weiß. Die Obdachlosen werden von den sozialen Dienstleistungen angezogen, die Portland besser als die meisten Teile des Landes bietet, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind unzureichend, wie es in allen Teilen des Landes der Fall ist. Die Bevölkerung, die nicht obdachlos ist, schwankt zwischen Mitgefühl und Hass. In diesem Punkt sind wir nicht weird.",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, they witness the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how engrossed I am in work and life, they remain steadfast, unyielding, and unperturbed by life's challenges. On days when I am most stressed and overwhelmed, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they allow me to find solace for my anxious soul, lending me the strength to endure, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergraduate studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also hold a piece of my heart, but it is the mountains that truly hold sway. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an atmosphere of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as its neighboring urban city. This doesn't last for many blocks, however, as one can quickly escape back to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such close proximity truly gives this city a wondrous vibe, as if it is inviting exploration. With this, it is easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch a movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects living out their lives, each with their own role, I couldn't help but ponder my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The strong, overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily workout. Since there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block look tattered. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines, and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-like. There are many tall evergreen trees all around wherever you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. It took me three hours to scrape it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.",
            "Ich lebe in einer typischen Vorortsiedlung in einer kleinen südlichen Stadt in Tennessee. Es ist eine Verbindungsstraße zwischen zwei Staatsstraßen, sodass wir etwas mehr Verkehr auf der Straße haben, als ich möchte, aber abgesehen davon ist es eine ruhige Nachbarschaft. Es gibt nicht viele Leute, die hier ein- und ausziehen, sodass ich die majority of the people, die in der Nachbarschaft leben, kenne. Die Menschen beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Aufgaben. Im Winter fahren wir mit Schlitten einen Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße hinab. Wir wohnen in einem Haus an der Ecke unserer Straße, sodass wir jeden Menschen sehen, der kommt und geht, und die Autos, die hier fahren, kennen. Wenn wir ein unbekanntes Fahrzeug sehen, notieren wir es uns. Einige der Nachbarn gehen zum Spazierengehen oder um ihre Hunde auszuführen. Kinder spielen auf ihren Fahrrädern und das Ganze, was man von einer solchen Nachbarschaft erwarten würde. Wir sind die meiste Zeit zu Hause, da wir von unserem Haus aus arbeiten. Es gibt vier von uns: mich selbst, meine Frau und zwei Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn Jahren. Also, ich würde sagen, dass alle anderen es gewohnt sind, uns zu sehen. Wir gehen nach draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir auch auf unserer hinteren Terrasse und es ist immer ein angenehmer Geruch vom Grill. Es scheint immer jemand zu sein, der Rasen mäht, und man hört fast jeden Tag von März bis etwa Oktober, wenn das Gras schließlich aufhört zu wachsen. In unserer Nachbarschaft gibt es viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, sodass es viele Schatten gibt, aber es gibt auch immer viele Blätter im Herbst. Das bedeutet, dass wir jedes Jahr Blätter fegen und verbrennen müssen. Ich mag den Geruch von verbrannten Blättern und das ist immer ein Zeichen, dass der Herbst gekommen ist. In letzter Zeit haben wir nicht viel Winter gehabt, sodass es sich nur wie ein langer Herbst anfühlt. Unsere Garage befindet sich hinten im Haus, sodass wir die Vordertür unseres Hauses nur verwenden, wenn jemand anklopft, was selten vorkommt. Ich mag es, in der Garage an meinem Truck oder anderen Projekten zu arbeiten und wenn ich die Garagentore offen habe, fühle ich mich mehr mit der Nachbarschaft verbunden. An Feiertagen ist es hier recht ruhig. Thanksgiving sieht einige der Familien in unserer Nachbarschaft, die mit Leuten aus der Ferne zu Besuch sind und es gibt extra geparkte Autos während dieser Zeit des Jahres. Das ist auch bei anderen Feiertagen wie Muttertag und Weihnachten so. Insgesamt gefällt es mir hier zu leben. Wenn es nicht eine Durchgangsstraße wäre, wäre es perfekt.",
            "My neighborhood is right in the middle of the high desert, where there's just dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of seeing brown all the time, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I think that's how most places are changing. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people and I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic, you have to travel, I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, there's still a lot of open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they're all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I'm writing this now they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus where I live, and the people living in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory houses. In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people per room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. The actual houses available for anyone with an affiliation to the school are typically 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory-style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school is really its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the school's own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!",
            "Well, since I've been here for about 10 years, I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first moved to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis, who lived right next to us. They were enjoyable people that I almost consider as family, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (he got remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Mrs. Veda, took off the little white strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, but now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only gone so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, it’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad and my best friend were raised by Mr. Graves in tennis, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",
            "Meine Nachbarschaft besteht aus Duplexen, die entlang einer Sackgasse gebaut sind. Sie sind unregelmäßig platziert und beabstandet, sodass sie wie individuelle Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass sie alle gelb gestrichen sind, mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends oft am Ende eines nicht vorgegebenen Zufahrtsweges und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, technisch/mechanisch/füllenden Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Zeitreise. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die von einem blauen Himmel und weißen Wolken überzogen sind. Der einzige Nachteil? In dieser Saison erleben wir Tornadowarnungen und gestern Abend hörten wir tatsächlich Tornadosirenen, sodass wir Zuflucht suchen mussten. Tatsächlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, die ich mit meinem kleinsten Hund, meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen ausfüllte. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, nervös wegen der merkwürdigen Situation. Die Nachbarschaft war still, bis auf das Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf dem Boden niederging. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße wörtlich, weil die Temperatur von 92 auf 75 Grad fiel. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben sah, klarte der Himmel auf und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren genauso beeindruckt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde still, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wo sie sich befanden, als der Gewittersturm losging. Dann war wieder alles wie zuvor, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Das ist eine sehr freundliche Nachbarschaft für eine Frau, die vor Kurzem aus NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe die southern Akzente, die die Menschen sprechen. Ich habe eine Zwei-Zimmer-Wohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, wie fast alle. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Apartments im Inneren nicht alle gleich. Einige sind überraschend klein. Das macht für mich keinen Sinn. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen geeignet ist. Dort habe ich Hirsche gesehen und morgens kann man den Gesang der großen Frosch hören. Es ist ein wunderbarer Ort zum Leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird der Tag vom Krähen der Hähne von den umliegenden Farmen begrüßt. Es ist fast wie in einem kleinen Dorf zu leben. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einem nahen Hof, den man abends brayen hört und so wissen wir, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, diesen Juwel von einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.",
            "I moved into this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Making friends was hard initially, but I eventually became close to someone who lives two houses down and another guy who lives on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but the memories remain. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is quite similar to an average American suburban neighborhood. It has a lot of two-story houses. On warm weekends or whenever it's warm outside, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with my neighbors. You're pretty much left alone here unless you need help. I've ordered numerous online packages and never had one snatched from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park just a few minutes' walk from my house. I have many memories there, including playing basketball, football, and baseball with other neighborhood kids. I also have a bad memory from getting elbowed in the nose while playing football, but the good memories far outweigh the bad. Now, when I go to the park, it's usually to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides. The thought of going to the park excites them. The park brings back many nostalgic feelings for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse. Nearby, you can find all sorts of food, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food shops are common, but they're usually found in any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are even owned by Indians if you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm fond of my neighborhood. Seeing and reading about the horror stories some people have with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from other towns in South Carolina, but it significantly impacts the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside of the town center are spread far apart; most are two-story homes with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's only stores are located. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery store. Most residents prefer to shop at Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, selling a wide range of everyday items and often busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-known woman who employs two movers for deliveries. Attached to the store is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being created to provide more opportunities for outings and attract visitors. Despite the lack of entertainment options like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, it's a pleasant town, so small that one might easily pass through without noticing.",
            "The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who had gone missing. It was quite surprising. Virtually every apartment in the area rented for more than a thousand dollars a month. I had never heard anything like this, neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Everything is expensive, but we've learned to be frugal over the years. You get used to the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You notice less smell as you get older. You might start smoking, or you might just become accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market is always there. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It lingers in the leather and stays even after you wash it. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start from the far side, you can also visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling with cars and people every morning, but you won't hear any of it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the stores remain silent. It's a great place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more people and cars. It's a growing city, they say. With one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still going through growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone has their own goals, and no one asks much of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will respect that. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here. You can keep your distance as long as you like, and the city will pass by like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to live. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we live among less strangers and more friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me very well. I make sure to keep things clean and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I even bring them mail, and they bring me theirs. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I live in a vast, dehumanizing modernist sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I didn't ruin my life after all.",
            "The general area I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is situated just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, can be described as the most economically disadvantaged part of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by individuals with low income. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but they are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime, except for an occasional item disappearing from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been significantly impacted by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "Ich lebe in ländlicher America, genauer gesagt in einer kleinen Stadt in Michigan. Von Farmland zu kleinen touristischen Städten; keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Walmart, Target oder sogar ein Applebees. Alles, was du brauchst, musst du mit dem Auto erreichen. Trotz allem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Das schöne Lake Michigan liegt auf einer Seite, und auf der anderen Seite das Lake Charlevoix. Überall, wohin du gehst, findest du einen Strand, um deine Füße einzutauchen. Mein Wohnviertel spiegelt den Geist einer kleinen Stadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht aufeinander gestapelt. Es sind keine gleichartigen Fertighäuser; sie sind older Homes, einige renoviert und modernisiert, andere älter. Viele Häuser haben Kellerräume, die von der Straße aus visiblesind. Viele Häuser im Viertel haben ältere Aluminiumfassaden. In den Blöcken um mein Haus herum gibt es Häuser in jeder erdenklichen Farbe. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten, Trampoline und Spielgeräte. Einige haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem klassischen amerikanischen Stil. Es sind hart arbeitende Menschen, die versuchen, ein Einkommen zu erzielen und entweder Familien aufziehen oder sie bereits großgezogen haben. Jeden Tag sieht man Kinder auf und ab die Straße entlang laufen. Man sieht auch Menschen, die ihre Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren und Rollerbladen. Nachbarn kennen sich und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden, der draußen grillt und winkt, oder jemand, der seinen Hund ein paar Blocks weiter ausführt und nett grüßt. Die Rasen sind in gutem Zustand. Niemand hat Blätter aus dem Herbst, die sich stapeln. Das Gras wird gemäht und ist unter Kontrolle. Wenn die Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind sie gestutzt. Es ist kein schöner Stadtteil, in den man fährt und denkt, wow, schöne Häuser, sondern einer, in den man fährt und denkt, hier könnte man eine Familie aufziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es sich nur um einen durchschnittlichen Stadtteil handelt, ist er besonders, weil er das wünscht, was die Menschen in der Welt suchen: einen sicheren Ort, an den sie am Ende des Tages zurückkehren können. Innerhalb weniger Gehminuten erreicht man das County Sheriff's Department und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt ist direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum liegt nur ein paar Straßen weiter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner der Stadt nutzen die Dienstleistungen, die sie anbieten. Es gibt Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, auf denen man die Ansager hören kann, die die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler rufen. Unser kleines Stadtflughafen liegt direkt daneben, und man kann draußen spielen oder drinnen sein und das Brummen kleiner Flugzeuge beim Starten und Landen hören. Man kann zu Fuß Eiscreme bei dem local Ice Cream Place kaufen, und wenn man es wirklich möchte, kann man mit dem Fahrrad in die Innenstadt fahren, die nur 8 Blocks von unserem Wohnviertel entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich guter Ort, um zu leben."
