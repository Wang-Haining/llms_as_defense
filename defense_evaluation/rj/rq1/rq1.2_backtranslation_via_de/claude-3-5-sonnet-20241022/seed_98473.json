            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into small tourist towns. There are no large shopping malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You need to drive wherever you want to go. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is embraced by water - the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. You can find a beach to dip your toes in wherever you go.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies small-town life. The houses aren't cramped together or cookie-cutter designs. They're older homes, some renovated and remodeled, others maintaining their original character. Most have full basements visible from the street, and many sport vintage aluminum siding. The houses in our area come in every imaginable color. Most properties have yards with trampolines and play equipment. Some residents maintain gardens and have fenced areas for their pets.\n\nThese homes reflect Middle America - hardworking people making a living, either raising families or having already raised them. Children play in the streets daily, while people walk their dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can tell who belongs and who doesn't. You'll exchange waves with someone grilling outdoors or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away.\n\nThe properties are well-maintained, with no leftover autumn leaves, neatly mowed lawns, and trimmed bushes and plants. While it's not a neighborhood that makes you gasp at luxurious homes, it's one that suggests \"this is a good place to raise a family.\" It's peaceful, quiet, and secure - though average in appearance, it exemplifies what people want: a safe haven at day's end.\n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department next door, and the city recycling center down the road, which serves the whole community. Nearby baseball and softball fields fill the air with the sound of announcers calling games. Our small town airport provides the backdrop of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and ambitious walkers can reach downtown. My children can bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is an wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I live can be characterized as a typical, uniformly designed suburb. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association (HOA) is very noticeable. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but meticulously maintained single-family homes, which we can attribute to the HOA. The front yards share a striking similarity - each featuring a modest patch of manicured lawn, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Small trees dot the landscape occasionally. Every home has a two-car garage.\n\nThroughout the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved roads in pristine condition, with no signs of deterioration or potholes despite the numerous families residing here. While most houses are single-story, you'll occasionally encounter two-story homes. Our mail delivery system differs from the traditional setup - instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have centralized mail stations at the end of each street, similar to apartment complexes. Each resident has a key to access their designated mailbox, and there are two larger compartments for packages - another example of the HOA's preference for uniformity.\n\nOur location on the city's outskirts creates an interesting blend of rural and suburban living. The neighborhood boasts extensive amenities, including multiple well-maintained, gated community pools accessible to all residents. There are various walking trails perfect for dog walking or evening strolls. The neighborhood's size eliminates the need for a separate exercise venue - you can get plenty of physical activity just by running within the community.\n\nThe demographic primarily consists of retirees, with a smaller mixture of middle-aged residents and young professionals. It's a secure area where neighbors look out for each other. The city itself is surprisingly populous while maintaining a small-town atmosphere. We have access to most modern convenities, including a modest but functional mall. Most destinations require about 15 minutes of driving, but once there, you'll find numerous shopping options ranging from upscale organic grocery stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staffing to keep prices low.\n\nOverall, our neighborhood embodies safety, good maintenance, and typical suburban living. While we may not be immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive provides access to any major retail chain you might need, and we enjoy excellent amenities like community pools and walking trails.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars monthly. I had never heard anything about that story, and neither had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Life is expensive, but we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You grow to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and second-hand clothes. Your sense of smell dulls in adulthood. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just become numb to how things are. But the flea market always makes its presence known. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and stays even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is packed, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains silent. It's a perfect place to while away an afternoon. Each year brings more of those crowds. Cars and people flood in. They call it a developing city. Home to one of the largest online retail and delivery empires, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone focuses on their own goals, and nobody asks much of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and independent, and people respect that. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of caring, people here don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city ebbs and flows like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to live. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less a building of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together when needed, celebrate birthdays, share in grief, and help each other when possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail deliveries. It's pleasant seeing them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Though I live in an enormous, impersonal modern urban sprawl, it's people like my neighbors who make me feel I haven't completely derailed my life.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town located just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood on the east side could be considered the most economically challenged area of town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented or owned by low-income residents. Nevertheless, it's neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and greet you when walking down the street. While crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been several violent incidents within a few blocks of my house over the past decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. Like many parts of the United States, our town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, our town offers numerous resources to combat this crisis, including several rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has exceptional staff throughout, and despite his special needs, he has experienced no bullying thanks to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere. We have an active PTO organizing various events throughout the year. Given that over 20% of our population lives below the poverty line, all students receive free breakfast and lunch. No family is treated differently due to financial circumstances, and school-related costs are kept reasonable. While the City Council has made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations, these improvements have primarily focused on the central and western areas, leaving the east side somewhat neglected - a source of frustration for our neighborhood. Overall, I find life here satisfying. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and meets our needs. After living here for over 16 years, we couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood pulses with cultural diversity. Perched on a hill, it's embraced by buildings steeped in history. I reside in a seven-story apartment building opposite the historic theater, and just down The Hill lies a charming arcade bar that attracts an eclectic crowd on balmy summer evenings. Particularly during June and July weekends, you'll find people queuing to enter. A few blocks uphill sits the nearest city park, impressively sized for its urban location. The park is bordered by concrete walls with broad steps carved into them. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the rain is persistent, and the winter's torrential downpours make staying warm a challenge. By clustering their tents together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they find better warmth and remain within walking distance of the area's only family center, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat captivates me about my city isn't just its historic grandeur - the majestic buildings and varied architecture cascading down hills toward the ocean. Rather, it's the cultural fabric of its people. Hilltop was once notorious across the West Coast for gang activity. Even thirty years later, stories circulate about federal agents and DEA operations sweeping through like a cleansing tide. The community preserves these memories, passing them down through generations, even to newcomers like myself. Despite still being considered one of the city's rougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain their neighborhood's integrity.\n\nThough some warn white people against walking The Hill after dark, I see this caution as an echo of the past, tainted by social prejudice. Perhaps it's because I'm ambiguous enough not to read as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop accepts me as one of its own - someone equally conscious of our nation's ongoing struggles with racism, cultural bias, and fear-based assumptions, even in a supposedly progressive urban melting pot.\n\nOne thing remains certain: Hilltop is home, regardless of where life takes me. These streets pulse with life at night, where I've encountered more people offering me protection than threat. It's where laundromat owners extend their hours to shelter someone from the rain, where strangers recognize humanity in those who feel invisible, offering not just money but dignity and hope.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another boy from my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved in are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or when it's warm, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had problems with any neighbors. People here leave you alone unless you need help. I've ordered packages online many times and never had one stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball there with other boys from the neighborhood. I also experienced one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. These days, I only go there with my cousin's children. They're much younger than me and still enjoy swings, slides, and things like that. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park makes me nostalgic for many different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within about a mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered. The most popular places are fast-food restaurants, but you can find those near almost any suburban neighborhood. There are also many pizzerias. The stores here have everything you might need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco supermarket, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are multicultural, like an Indian store if you want to make homemade Indian food or buy ready-made Indian dishes. Overall, I really like my neighborhood. When I read about horror stories others have with their neighbors on social media and in the news, I'm grateful for mine.",
            "I live near the college I attend, which makes it a really enjoyable place for me. The area is dominated by apartment buildings, with several reasonably priced restaurants and bars scattered throughout. One bar recently underwent a name change - it's a bit pricier now, but the service and drinks are still decent. The community is mostly friendly, consisting of college students and working-class residents, given the affordable housing options. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance. While I don't know my neighbors personally (and prefer it that way), I find it amusing that management installed an air freshener opposite their door due to their frequent cannabis use.\n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older, though some have updated interiors. New apartments further down the street, despite their expensive rent, were poorly constructed - a clear exploitation of the campus location. There's an inexpensive restaurant nearby that serves microwaved food on paper plates, and a gas station with a reportedly poor work environment. Recent city funding improved the area with new sidewalks and landscaping, making it more attractive. My building is surrounded by trees, though some were recently removed, and there's significantly more greenery here than in other parts of the neighborhood.\n\nI'm on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind us, which is notably less maintained with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's been some criminal activity in the area, particularly in certain complexes, I'm generally satisfied with my living situation. The rent is affordable, amenities are convenient, and I especially appreciate being able to walk to the university and having easy access to public transportation for reaching stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged and spaced to resemble single-family homes. Their distinguishing feature is their uniform yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Nearly everyone here has formed friendships, creating a close-knit community. On many evenings, we gather spontaneously at the end of driveways to chat while neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's refreshing to experience this in our modern, technology-driven world - like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, complemented by blue skies and billowing white clouds.\n\nThe only drawback? This season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard actual tornado sirens that sent us seeking shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, anxious about the unusual situation, refused to leave the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road literally steamed from the dramatic temperature drop - from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged while it was still raining, creating a double rainbow. I rushed to capture photos for my Facebook friends and family, who were as amazed as I was.\n\nThe streets remained quiet for an hour until people returned from their storm shelters, then life resumed its normal rhythm with mothers and children outside as dinner cooked. Having recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find this friendly neighborhood charming and love the Southern accents. While we all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, and the buildings look identical outside, the interior layouts vary surprisingly, with some units being quite compact. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home to the pond (though it's not for swimming). I've spotted deer, and mornings bring the deep songs of bullfrogs. Located just forty minutes outside Charlotte, it's a fantastic place to live. Each morning begins with roosters crowing from nearby farms, creating the atmosphere of a small village community. We even have a neighborhood donkey who announces his presence with evening brays. I truly feel fortunate to have discovered this neighborhood gem.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I can share my experiences. When I first moved to this neighborhood from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was quite emotional - I'll admit I shed tears because I missed my old community dearly. My parents made this move for better opportunities for me and my sister - better housing, better schooling, and what people would consider a \"nicer\" area. Time helped me adjust, and I found both friends and rivals at school. While I didn't get to know most neighbors well over the years, Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, our immediate neighbors, became almost like family to me. I have fond memories of attending Mr. Glen's second wedding with my family. It was a joyous celebration where I even caught the garter, though the bouquet eluded me! I had a wonderful time dancing with their daughter Marsharii, whom I haven't seen since but hope is thriving wherever she is. The neighborhood itself is quite intricate, though GPS helps me explore it now. I've ventured around with my friends Kason and Curtis, spending countless hours gaming and living life to its fullest. I find peace in visiting the local park, practicing balance with my training sticks from Home Depot, and sometimes bringing my wooden bokken sword. While I haven't used them recently, having tennis and basketball courts nearby is wonderful. My father and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me tennis - it was demanding but enjoyable. While I have many more stories about this neighborhood, these memories stand out most, and I'm confident the best is still ahead!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not stand out among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The landscape is dominated by peach orchards and cattle farms. Houses outside the town center are generously spaced, typically two stories high with either metal roofs designed to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Most residences are set back from the road, leaving front fields available for livestock or crops.\n\nThe town center features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all local businesses are concentrated. There are three dining options: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese establishment, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizza place once operated here but recently closed. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, has earned local fame for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's sole grocery store, IGA (Independent Grocers Alliance), though somewhat expensive, serves mainly for quick purchases, as most residents prefer traveling to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping.\n\nDollar General is the town's busiest establishment, offering various everyday items and staying active throughout its business hours. Possibilities Furniture & More, managed by a well-respected community member, has served the town for many years, complete with delivery service. The same building houses Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming, daycare, boarding, and related services.\n\nBoth medical and veterinary practices operate outside the town center - small but well-equipped facilities serving Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town; older students must attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While the town currently lacks parks, there's an ongoing project to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers.\n\nThe town admittedly offers limited entertainment options, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social venues, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or extensive dining choices. Nevertheless, it maintains its charm as a small town - one you might miss in the blink of an eye!",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise it's a peaceful neighborhood. There isn't much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people who live here. People generally keep themselves busy with yard work and daily routines. In winter, we go sledding down a hill on our side street. We live in a house on the front corner of our street, which means we see everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the vehicles that frequent our area. We tend to notice when unfamiliar vehicles appear. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and engage in typical activities you'd expect. We're home frequently since we work from here. There are four of us - my wife and I, plus our two daughters who are eleven and fourteen. Everyone knows our patterns too. We enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Sometimes we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with pleasant cooking aromas. Someone's always mowing their lawn here from March through October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally wooded, has many trees providing shade, though this means plenty of leaf-raking and burning in autumn. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves - it's a wonderful sign of fall's arrival. Recently, our winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended autumn. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door except for occasional visitors. When I'm working in the garage on my truck or other projects with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are typically quiet here, though Thanksgiving brings out-of-town visitors and extra cars parked throughout the area. The same happens during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here - it would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "I live in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by endless expanses of dirt. Unless you've lived here yourself, it's hard to grasp the constant presence of brown landscapes, and when you do spot a green lawn, you know its owner is investing heavily in its maintenance. When I first settled here in the 90s, houses were few and far between. While that spacing remains similar today, many new developments have sprung up. The area is increasingly taking on an urban character, though this seems to be a common trend everywhere.\n\nThe community is generally friendly, though like any populated area, it has its better and worse sections. My immediate neighborhood is filled with friendly elderly residents, suggesting it's one of the nicer areas. The local businesses are predominantly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you need to travel elsewhere, as we lack establishments like Whole Foods.\n\nConstruction appears to be the dominant industry here, though I'm not citing official statistics. This makes sense given how underdeveloped the area remains, with plenty of open space for building. This prospect concerns me somewhat, as I appreciate the current atmosphere, having left big city life behind deliberately.\n\nConstruction is actually my field of work - I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the things I most appreciate about living here is the wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for various reasons, particularly its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape have created distinctive ecosystems that require protection and host diverse wildlife. It's important for residents to understand their non-human neighbors to ensure peaceful coexistence.\n\nMy family has adapted well to desert life. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects - even now, they're outside hunting for different specimens. We have several attractions in the area, including the San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville, which offers a unique desert experience. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports opportunities. For those interested in natural history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that chronicle the area's development.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my response is rather unique. Unlike others who might describe traditional residential areas, my situation is somewhat different. I consider my neighborhood to be my college campus, with my dormitory community serving as my immediate community. I also view the broader campus as my extended neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this unusual circumstance, my neighborhood shares many characteristics with more traditional neighborhoods, including housing, residents, shops, and recreational areas.\n\nLet me elaborate on the housing options in my area. There are three distinct types: apartment complexes, traditional houses, and dormitories. The apartments typically accommodate 2-4 residents per unit, with 4-6 units per floor across two floors, housing approximately 20 people per building. Then there are conventional houses, available for rent to those affiliated with the university, usually occupied by alumni in 2-4 bedroom arrangements, though these are less common due to space inefficiency. The dormitories, which are most prevalent, house hundreds of students, typically with two students sharing a room.\n\nOur community takes pride in its diversity, with residents representing various cultures and age groups. Professional staff typically occupy the houses, while newer students reside in dormitories and upperclassmen tend to live in apartments. The community is too vibrant and diverse to be adequately captured in words alone.\n\nAs for amenities, our campus functions as a self-contained neighborhood with numerous shops and a central park. The retail options include various dining establishments similar to any traditional neighborhood, along with university-branded clothing stores and grocery outlets, ensuring all essential needs are met within our boundaries. Our park serves as a communal gathering space for our diverse population, maintained and secured through the collective effort of all community members.",
            "There are hardly any sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downhill, and my house sits right at the peak of the neighborhood's steepest hill. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers enjoy running up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pockmarked in places and can feel somewhat treacherous to drive on. Some of the telephone and power lines around the area look tattered. Our area gets frequent rain and storms, so branches and other debris often damage the power lines, and the constant repairs give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look, but locals dislike them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second floors that rise one after another to capture the bay view. It's spectacular at sunset when the water appears to glow from beneath and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so most sunlight filters through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything - roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had become green and fuzzy with moss, taking three hours to scrape clean. There aren't many children in my area, despite a school being just blocks away. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs, which you often see lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door or window open, and you might find one wandering into your house - I once found one in my living room and had to guide it back out. Wild rabbits roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they damage plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats, however, love them and have hunted most from our neighborhood. We get typical birds: sparrows and hummingbirds, with occasional hawks or eagles that get chased away by local crows. While there are no stores nearby, a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals several restaurants serving fresh seafood. Though there's little beach, the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide - you can clearly see the opposite shore even through the typical mist.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it! Public transit is readily available and remains one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst maintains an urban character that makes you feel very much part of New York City. During your visit, expect to see numerous Asian businesses throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has welcomed a significant Asian population. As a result, you'll find Asian-owned businesses on practically every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and these establishments are highly popular with locals due to their excellent food quality, competitive prices, and convenient locations. In my immediate vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking radius.\n\nHowever, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian – it's quite multicultural, home to immigrants and their first and second-generation American children. While many prominent local businesses are Asian-owned, the neighborhood also features a newly renovated park with ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playground equipment, and a splash pad for children to enjoy during summer. True to New York City's character, the parks reflect the area's diversity, with people of all backgrounds harmoniously sharing the space.\n\nThe neighborhood lacks major corporate buildings, featuring mainly co-op buildings, condominiums, and predominantly two-family houses. While most residents are friendly, noise can be an issue – expect to hear cars with loud music and revving engines, even in the early morning. Evening visitors should remain vigilant. Though generally safe, the neighborhood has its share of troublemakers, bullies, and thieves. I personally experienced bullying here years ago, and package theft remains an ongoing concern. Additionally, despite city fines for not cleaning up after dogs, some residents ignore these regulations, leaving unwanted surprises on sidewalks during morning commutes. The prevalent dog waste is particularly bothersome, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial city motto, displayed on the back of a building that simultaneously serves as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, and strip club - operating on the edge of legality for at least half of these ventures - is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this represents a nostalgic plea to remember Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less renowned and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it serves as an inviting call - come to Portland, where being called weird is actually a compliment.\n\nDespite the influx of wealthy Californians and the endless construction of condominiums to house them, Portland maintains its peculiarity. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what's typically rejected elsewhere. We still have modern conveniences and contemporary struggles - like the rest of America, we source most of our goods from China. While there are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, Portland has its share of normalcy too, with its yoga practitioners, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird simply means we take it all less seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrantly colored houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and \"free boxes\" during summer months. These free boxes - traditionally cardboard containers but sometimes plastic bags or crates - hold something magical: items that surprisingly often become perfect treasures for passersby. While typically containing clothes and books, they might hold anything.\n\nThis magical potential of discovering something while walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies Portland's essence - at least to me, though I'm just one variety of weird among thousands. Some of my neighbors would never consider selecting clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, actual yoga with real goats) or attending Timbers matches (our soccer team). Portland brims with people passionate about various pursuits, whether actively chasing their dreams or contemplating them over one too many drinks at the bar.\n\nIndeed, Portland faces its challenges - drug problems (often rooted in mental health issues, potentially exacerbated by our persistently rainy, cloudy weather) and homelessness. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services, though like everywhere else in the country, these services remain inadequate. The housed population oscillates between compassion and contempt - and in this regard, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains remain eternal. In the north, they witness the sun's path every morning and evening. No matter how much I might forget them or become entangled in work and life's demands, they stand there - unwavering, unchallenged, and unmoved by life's trials. On my most stressful and tense days, they command attention, and when I turn to face them, they allow my troubled soul to find peace, lending me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus immediately captured my heart. While the university itself offers stunning sights with its buildings, ponds, and trees - all of which hold a special place in my heart - it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The town itself possesses its own unique beauty. Countless cafés stand as testament to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown immerses you in an atmosphere of antiquity, with weathered, colored bricks adorning restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town pulses with the energy of its urban neighbor. This vibrancy doesn't extend far though, as one can quickly retreat to the peaceful small-town atmosphere past the library. This contrast of environments so close together gives the city a magical quality, inviting exploration. It's easy to collect precious memories here, each tied to a different corner of town. From late-night walks past rusty park swings with friends after pulling all-nighters, to rushing through the bustling downtown to catch a showing at the elegant theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like any place in life, it also harbors difficult memories. The ponds, particularly, serve both for reflection and tearful moments during late-night existential crises - the latter being something I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their purposeful lives, I often questioned my own place in life's grand puzzle. So I walked beyond the pond, past the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. There, the sun cast its brilliant light over the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I gazed at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as always - the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky, towering above all other structures on the horizon, wordlessly inspiring my resilience.",
            "At first glance, you might miss it - it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect to find places to live. At least, not places where most people would choose to make their home. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and past the hotels that only see annual occupants save for summer family reunions, and you'll discover a thriving community. Within these neighborhoods, along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes - arranged meticulously like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and lined up along the road. The first apartment complex you encounter has made headlines for some questionable activities, so we'll skip past that - appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes reveal an entirely different world, one that few local residents know exists. Facing these buildings stands a community college satellite campus - a quiet collection of buildings keeping watch over the street, where drowsy students arrive with coffee in hand at 7 AM to begin their day. Iron gates creak open to welcome them one by one, while frustrated commuters gesture and grumble about traffic delays on busy days. The street intersects with another residential road, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries on the other. The center features welcoming porch furniture and a languid ceiling fan that stirs the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the street, turning cartwheels across the spiky grass while bees drift between roadside flowers. Retired seniors walk their dogs along the path, frowning at skateboarding teenagers and politely acknowledging groups of teenage girls gathered near the playground, sharing gossip about boys and trending YouTube stars. A strip mall by the park houses an affordable sushi restaurant that's never too crowded, a pool supply store, and a nail salon. You could simultaneously prepare for pool season, get your nails done, and enjoy hibachi chicken - the convenience of strip mall life. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop where you often see park teenagers clutching sweating cups topped with various toppings while attempting skateboard tricks and vaping, believing it makes them look cool. This neighborhood represents a slice of Americana - a fragment of history in the unhurried South where even time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is fascinating. Most houses are single-family homes, though some have been divided into two units while remaining connected. My house has a modest front yard and a narrow driveway on its left side. Like most others, it reminds one of an era when suburban living embodied the American dream. This dream once united the people of this nation, but now it's fading. Yet my neighborhood and many others endure, still testifying that the dream lives on.\n\nThe residents aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the small yards aren't maintained quite like before, but every driveway still holds a car or two, and children still play as if their immediate surroundings were their entire universe. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire hope in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full of life. Each house looks different, yet somehow feels the same.\n\nThere's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family - perhaps the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, with children playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Most neighbors have lived here for generations, sharing stories of times when everyone knew everyone else.\n\nA former karate school has become a pharmacy - a sign of changing times. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at reduced prices, avoided by youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents seeking an affordable night out. A single expressway passes through our town, though the exits are in the neighboring community. A past petition for our own exit was defeated when elders convinced the city council it would harm the town's character.\n\nAs we build a new high school and debate a town mascot, I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would perfectly capture our community's essence - a blend of tradition and transformation.",
            "Living in a major city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly randomly among commercial districts, where various businesses operate. Some of these establishments consist of offices, while others are various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new dining options or shopping opportunities. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by major corporations, small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular. These aren't just found in various shopping malls, but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful and tranquil if not for their proximity to so many points of interest.\n\nThere are several nearby parks, which I've noticed are frequently visited by people with young children. Speaking of people, there's remarkable diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Extending slightly beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are many more people of various ethnicities and backgrounds, though they sometimes form their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, and many others, all just a few miles away.\n\nHowever, even a few miles can mean a lengthy journey. A mere 10-mile trip can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Despite some destinations being nearby, few people walk anywhere in my city. The city's vast size makes foot travel impractical for most residents. Consequently, we experience some of the world's worst traffic congestion, and parking is a constant challenge nearly everywhere.\n\nIronically, recent years have seen extensive construction, particularly of large apartment complexes. While the city appears to be a popular destination, many current residents are concerned about the prospect of more people moving in and additional vehicles on the roads. However, housing in my city is diverse. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of various sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes.\n\nThis variety extends to my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. The community includes people of all ages, though truthfully, I'm not acquainted with most of my neighbors. While it's not particularly close-knit nowadays, I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and other neighborhood friends who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we passed the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she would be shocked by the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, she had never witnessed such expansive space in her life. Overwhelmed by the endless cornfields, I shared stories of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Following a two-lane country road, you'll find a water-filled quarry, and just beyond it lies the small development I call home. The houses, primarily built of brick and stucco, each sit on at least half an acre of meticulously maintained land. Spring brings an abundance of annual flowers alongside Midwestern trees that transform with each season. Driveways showcase gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles, freshly washed and sparkling in the midday sun. Along the road to my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor can always be found outside, wearing a friendly smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn, singing over the mower's drone. While the neighborhood finds him amusing, he remains genuine and remarkable, with a fascinating history. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, this former doctor blends seamlessly with his surroundings and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. At my home, geese populate the side yard, perpetually pursued by our Terrier. The backyard features a small stream flowing into the quarry, where bullfrogs, running water, and occasional moos from nearby farms create a pastoral symphony. Beyond a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers - my childhood playground. From constructing tree forts to chasing wildlife, adventure always awaited, usually shared with neighborhood friends. Though winters here can be ruthlessly harsh, they possess their own beauty. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness, and trees once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange blossoms become bare silhouettes. Snowfall creates overnight wonderlands, where my sister's snow angels and snowmen line the backyard. Our childhood rivalries often played out in winter warfare, with snowballs as ammunition and elaborate fort-arsenals built from snow and branches. In this magical realm, we lived out our make-believe adventures, carefree children in a world where nothing else mattered."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into small tourist towns. There are no large shopping malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You need to drive wherever you want to go. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is embraced by water - the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. You can find a beach to dip your toes in wherever you go.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies small-town life. The houses aren't cramped together or cookie-cutter designs. They're older homes, some renovated and remodeled, others maintaining their original character. Most have full basements visible from the street, and many sport vintage aluminum siding. The houses in our area come in every imaginable color. Most properties have yards with trampolines and play equipment. Some residents maintain gardens and have fenced areas for their pets.\n\nThese homes reflect Middle America - hardworking people making a living, either raising families or having already raised them. Children play in the streets daily, while people walk their dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can tell who belongs and who doesn't. You'll exchange waves with someone grilling outdoors or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away.\n\nThe properties are well-maintained, with no leftover autumn leaves, neatly mowed lawns, and trimmed bushes and plants. While it's not a neighborhood that makes you gasp at luxurious homes, it's one that suggests \"this is a good place to raise a family.\" It's peaceful, quiet, and secure - though average in appearance, it exemplifies what people want: a safe haven at day's end.\n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department next door, and the city recycling center down the road, which serves the whole community. Nearby baseball and softball fields fill the air with the sound of announcers calling games. Our small town airport provides the backdrop of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and ambitious walkers can reach downtown. My children can bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is an wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I live can be characterized as a typical, uniformly designed suburb. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association (HOA) is very noticeable. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but meticulously maintained single-family homes, which we can attribute to the HOA. The front yards share a striking similarity - each featuring a modest patch of manicured lawn, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Small trees dot the landscape occasionally. Every home has a two-car garage.\n\nThroughout the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved roads in pristine condition, with no signs of deterioration or potholes despite the numerous families residing here. While most houses are single-story, you'll occasionally encounter two-story homes. Our mail delivery system differs from the traditional setup - instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have centralized mail stations at the end of each street, similar to apartment complexes. Each resident has a key to access their designated mailbox, and there are two larger compartments for packages - another example of the HOA's preference for uniformity.\n\nOur location on the city's outskirts creates an interesting blend of rural and suburban living. The neighborhood boasts extensive amenities, including multiple well-maintained, gated community pools accessible to all residents. There are various walking trails perfect for dog walking or evening strolls. The neighborhood's size eliminates the need for a separate exercise venue - you can get plenty of physical activity just by running within the community.\n\nThe demographic primarily consists of retirees, with a smaller mixture of middle-aged residents and young professionals. It's a secure area where neighbors look out for each other. The city itself is surprisingly populous while maintaining a small-town atmosphere. We have access to most modern convenities, including a modest but functional mall. Most destinations require about 15 minutes of driving, but once there, you'll find numerous shopping options ranging from upscale organic grocery stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staffing to keep prices low.\n\nOverall, our neighborhood embodies safety, good maintenance, and typical suburban living. While we may not be immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive provides access to any major retail chain you might need, and we enjoy excellent amenities like community pools and walking trails.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars monthly. I had never heard anything about that story, and neither had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Life is expensive, but we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You grow to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and second-hand clothes. Your sense of smell dulls in adulthood. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just become numb to how things are. But the flea market always makes its presence known. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and stays even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is packed, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains silent. It's a perfect place to while away an afternoon. Each year brings more of those crowds. Cars and people flood in. They call it a developing city. Home to one of the largest online retail and delivery empires, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone focuses on their own goals, and nobody asks much of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and independent, and people respect that. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of caring, people here don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city ebbs and flows like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to live. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less a building of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together when needed, celebrate birthdays, share in grief, and help each other when possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail deliveries. It's pleasant seeing them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Though I live in an enormous, impersonal modern urban sprawl, it's people like my neighbors who make me feel I haven't completely derailed my life.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town located just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood on the east side could be considered the most economically challenged area of town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented or owned by low-income residents. Nevertheless, it's neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and greet you when walking down the street. While crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been several violent incidents within a few blocks of my house over the past decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. Like many parts of the United States, our town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, our town offers numerous resources to combat this crisis, including several rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has exceptional staff throughout, and despite his special needs, he has experienced no bullying thanks to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere. We have an active PTO organizing various events throughout the year. Given that over 20% of our population lives below the poverty line, all students receive free breakfast and lunch. No family is treated differently due to financial circumstances, and school-related costs are kept reasonable. While the City Council has made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations, these improvements have primarily focused on the central and western areas, leaving the east side somewhat neglected - a source of frustration for our neighborhood. Overall, I find life here satisfying. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and meets our needs. After living here for over 16 years, we couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood pulses with cultural diversity. Perched on a hill, it's embraced by buildings steeped in history. I reside in a seven-story apartment building opposite the historic theater, and just down The Hill lies a charming arcade bar that attracts an eclectic crowd on balmy summer evenings. Particularly during June and July weekends, you'll find people queuing to enter. A few blocks uphill sits the nearest city park, impressively sized for its urban location. The park is bordered by concrete walls with broad steps carved into them. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the rain is persistent, and the winter's torrential downpours make staying warm a challenge. By clustering their tents together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they find better warmth and remain within walking distance of the area's only family center, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat captivates me about my city isn't just its historic grandeur - the majestic buildings and varied architecture cascading down hills toward the ocean. Rather, it's the cultural fabric of its people. Hilltop was once notorious across the West Coast for gang activity. Even thirty years later, stories circulate about federal agents and DEA operations sweeping through like a cleansing tide. The community preserves these memories, passing them down through generations, even to newcomers like myself. Despite still being considered one of the city's rougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain their neighborhood's integrity.\n\nThough some warn white people against walking The Hill after dark, I see this caution as an echo of the past, tainted by social prejudice. Perhaps it's because I'm ambiguous enough not to read as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop accepts me as one of its own - someone equally conscious of our nation's ongoing struggles with racism, cultural bias, and fear-based assumptions, even in a supposedly progressive urban melting pot.\n\nOne thing remains certain: Hilltop is home, regardless of where life takes me. These streets pulse with life at night, where I've encountered more people offering me protection than threat. It's where laundromat owners extend their hours to shelter someone from the rain, where strangers recognize humanity in those who feel invisible, offering not just money but dignity and hope.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another boy from my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved in are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or when it's warm, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had problems with any neighbors. People here leave you alone unless you need help. I've ordered packages online many times and never had one stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball there with other boys from the neighborhood. I also experienced one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. These days, I only go there with my cousin's children. They're much younger than me and still enjoy swings, slides, and things like that. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park makes me nostalgic for many different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within about a mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered. The most popular places are fast-food restaurants, but you can find those near almost any suburban neighborhood. There are also many pizzerias. The stores here have everything you might need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco supermarket, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are multicultural, like an Indian store if you want to make homemade Indian food or buy ready-made Indian dishes. Overall, I really like my neighborhood. When I read about horror stories others have with their neighbors on social media and in the news, I'm grateful for mine.",
            "I live near the college I attend, which makes it a really enjoyable place for me. The area is dominated by apartment buildings, with several reasonably priced restaurants and bars scattered throughout. One bar recently underwent a name change - it's a bit pricier now, but the service and drinks are still decent. The community is mostly friendly, consisting of college students and working-class residents, given the affordable housing options. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance. While I don't know my neighbors personally (and prefer it that way), I find it amusing that management installed an air freshener opposite their door due to their frequent cannabis use.\n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older, though some have updated interiors. New apartments further down the street, despite their expensive rent, were poorly constructed - a clear exploitation of the campus location. There's an inexpensive restaurant nearby that serves microwaved food on paper plates, and a gas station with a reportedly poor work environment. Recent city funding improved the area with new sidewalks and landscaping, making it more attractive. My building is surrounded by trees, though some were recently removed, and there's significantly more greenery here than in other parts of the neighborhood.\n\nI'm on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind us, which is notably less maintained with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's been some criminal activity in the area, particularly in certain complexes, I'm generally satisfied with my living situation. The rent is affordable, amenities are convenient, and I especially appreciate being able to walk to the university and having easy access to public transportation for reaching stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged and spaced to resemble single-family homes. Their distinguishing feature is their uniform yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Nearly everyone here has formed friendships, creating a close-knit community. On many evenings, we gather spontaneously at the end of driveways to chat while neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's refreshing to experience this in our modern, technology-driven world - like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, complemented by blue skies and billowing white clouds.\n\nThe only drawback? This season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard actual tornado sirens that sent us seeking shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, anxious about the unusual situation, refused to leave the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road literally steamed from the dramatic temperature drop - from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged while it was still raining, creating a double rainbow. I rushed to capture photos for my Facebook friends and family, who were as amazed as I was.\n\nThe streets remained quiet for an hour until people returned from their storm shelters, then life resumed its normal rhythm with mothers and children outside as dinner cooked. Having recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find this friendly neighborhood charming and love the Southern accents. While we all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, and the buildings look identical outside, the interior layouts vary surprisingly, with some units being quite compact. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home to the pond (though it's not for swimming). I've spotted deer, and mornings bring the deep songs of bullfrogs. Located just forty minutes outside Charlotte, it's a fantastic place to live. Each morning begins with roosters crowing from nearby farms, creating the atmosphere of a small village community. We even have a neighborhood donkey who announces his presence with evening brays. I truly feel fortunate to have discovered this neighborhood gem.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I can share my experiences. When I first moved to this neighborhood from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was quite emotional - I'll admit I shed tears because I missed my old community dearly. My parents made this move for better opportunities for me and my sister - better housing, better schooling, and what people would consider a \"nicer\" area. Time helped me adjust, and I found both friends and rivals at school. While I didn't get to know most neighbors well over the years, Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, our immediate neighbors, became almost like family to me. I have fond memories of attending Mr. Glen's second wedding with my family. It was a joyous celebration where I even caught the garter, though the bouquet eluded me! I had a wonderful time dancing with their daughter Marsharii, whom I haven't seen since but hope is thriving wherever she is. The neighborhood itself is quite intricate, though GPS helps me explore it now. I've ventured around with my friends Kason and Curtis, spending countless hours gaming and living life to its fullest. I find peace in visiting the local park, practicing balance with my training sticks from Home Depot, and sometimes bringing my wooden bokken sword. While I haven't used them recently, having tennis and basketball courts nearby is wonderful. My father and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me tennis - it was demanding but enjoyable. While I have many more stories about this neighborhood, these memories stand out most, and I'm confident the best is still ahead!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not stand out among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The landscape is dominated by peach orchards and cattle farms. Houses outside the town center are generously spaced, typically two stories high with either metal roofs designed to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Most residences are set back from the road, leaving front fields available for livestock or crops.\n\nThe town center features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all local businesses are concentrated. There are three dining options: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese establishment, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizza place once operated here but recently closed. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, has earned local fame for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's sole grocery store, IGA (Independent Grocers Alliance), though somewhat expensive, serves mainly for quick purchases, as most residents prefer traveling to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping.\n\nDollar General is the town's busiest establishment, offering various everyday items and staying active throughout its business hours. Possibilities Furniture & More, managed by a well-respected community member, has served the town for many years, complete with delivery service. The same building houses Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming, daycare, boarding, and related services.\n\nBoth medical and veterinary practices operate outside the town center - small but well-equipped facilities serving Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town; older students must attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While the town currently lacks parks, there's an ongoing project to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers.\n\nThe town admittedly offers limited entertainment options, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social venues, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or extensive dining choices. Nevertheless, it maintains its charm as a small town - one you might miss in the blink of an eye!",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise it's a peaceful neighborhood. There isn't much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people who live here. People generally keep themselves busy with yard work and daily routines. In winter, we go sledding down a hill on our side street. We live in a house on the front corner of our street, which means we see everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the vehicles that frequent our area. We tend to notice when unfamiliar vehicles appear. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and engage in typical activities you'd expect. We're home frequently since we work from here. There are four of us - my wife and I, plus our two daughters who are eleven and fourteen. Everyone knows our patterns too. We enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Sometimes we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with pleasant cooking aromas. Someone's always mowing their lawn here from March through October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally wooded, has many trees providing shade, though this means plenty of leaf-raking and burning in autumn. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves - it's a wonderful sign of fall's arrival. Recently, our winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended autumn. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door except for occasional visitors. When I'm working in the garage on my truck or other projects with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are typically quiet here, though Thanksgiving brings out-of-town visitors and extra cars parked throughout the area. The same happens during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here - it would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "I live in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by endless expanses of dirt. Unless you've lived here yourself, it's hard to grasp the constant presence of brown landscapes, and when you do spot a green lawn, you know its owner is investing heavily in its maintenance. When I first settled here in the 90s, houses were few and far between. While that spacing remains similar today, many new developments have sprung up. The area is increasingly taking on an urban character, though this seems to be a common trend everywhere.\n\nThe community is generally friendly, though like any populated area, it has its better and worse sections. My immediate neighborhood is filled with friendly elderly residents, suggesting it's one of the nicer areas. The local businesses are predominantly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you need to travel elsewhere, as we lack establishments like Whole Foods.\n\nConstruction appears to be the dominant industry here, though I'm not citing official statistics. This makes sense given how underdeveloped the area remains, with plenty of open space for building. This prospect concerns me somewhat, as I appreciate the current atmosphere, having left big city life behind deliberately.\n\nConstruction is actually my field of work - I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the things I most appreciate about living here is the wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for various reasons, particularly its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape have created distinctive ecosystems that require protection and host diverse wildlife. It's important for residents to understand their non-human neighbors to ensure peaceful coexistence.\n\nMy family has adapted well to desert life. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects - even now, they're outside hunting for different specimens. We have several attractions in the area, including the San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville, which offers a unique desert experience. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports opportunities. For those interested in natural history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that chronicle the area's development.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my response is rather unique. Unlike others who might describe traditional residential areas, my situation is somewhat different. I consider my neighborhood to be my college campus, with my dormitory community serving as my immediate community. I also view the broader campus as my extended neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this unusual circumstance, my neighborhood shares many characteristics with more traditional neighborhoods, including housing, residents, shops, and recreational areas.\n\nLet me elaborate on the housing options in my area. There are three distinct types: apartment complexes, traditional houses, and dormitories. The apartments typically accommodate 2-4 residents per unit, with 4-6 units per floor across two floors, housing approximately 20 people per building. Then there are conventional houses, available for rent to those affiliated with the university, usually occupied by alumni in 2-4 bedroom arrangements, though these are less common due to space inefficiency. The dormitories, which are most prevalent, house hundreds of students, typically with two students sharing a room.\n\nOur community takes pride in its diversity, with residents representing various cultures and age groups. Professional staff typically occupy the houses, while newer students reside in dormitories and upperclassmen tend to live in apartments. The community is too vibrant and diverse to be adequately captured in words alone.\n\nAs for amenities, our campus functions as a self-contained neighborhood with numerous shops and a central park. The retail options include various dining establishments similar to any traditional neighborhood, along with university-branded clothing stores and grocery outlets, ensuring all essential needs are met within our boundaries. Our park serves as a communal gathering space for our diverse population, maintained and secured through the collective effort of all community members.",
            "There are hardly any sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downhill, and my house sits right at the peak of the neighborhood's steepest hill. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers enjoy running up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pockmarked in places and can feel somewhat treacherous to drive on. Some of the telephone and power lines around the area look tattered. Our area gets frequent rain and storms, so branches and other debris often damage the power lines, and the constant repairs give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look, but locals dislike them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second floors that rise one after another to capture the bay view. It's spectacular at sunset when the water appears to glow from beneath and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so most sunlight filters through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything - roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had become green and fuzzy with moss, taking three hours to scrape clean. There aren't many children in my area, despite a school being just blocks away. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs, which you often see lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door or window open, and you might find one wandering into your house - I once found one in my living room and had to guide it back out. Wild rabbits roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they damage plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats, however, love them and have hunted most from our neighborhood. We get typical birds: sparrows and hummingbirds, with occasional hawks or eagles that get chased away by local crows. While there are no stores nearby, a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals several restaurants serving fresh seafood. Though there's little beach, the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide - you can clearly see the opposite shore even through the typical mist.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it! Public transit is readily available and remains one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst maintains an urban character that makes you feel very much part of New York City. During your visit, expect to see numerous Asian businesses throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has welcomed a significant Asian population. As a result, you'll find Asian-owned businesses on practically every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and these establishments are highly popular with locals due to their excellent food quality, competitive prices, and convenient locations. In my immediate vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking radius.\n\nHowever, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian – it's quite multicultural, home to immigrants and their first and second-generation American children. While many prominent local businesses are Asian-owned, the neighborhood also features a newly renovated park with ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playground equipment, and a splash pad for children to enjoy during summer. True to New York City's character, the parks reflect the area's diversity, with people of all backgrounds harmoniously sharing the space.\n\nThe neighborhood lacks major corporate buildings, featuring mainly co-op buildings, condominiums, and predominantly two-family houses. While most residents are friendly, noise can be an issue – expect to hear cars with loud music and revving engines, even in the early morning. Evening visitors should remain vigilant. Though generally safe, the neighborhood has its share of troublemakers, bullies, and thieves. I personally experienced bullying here years ago, and package theft remains an ongoing concern. Additionally, despite city fines for not cleaning up after dogs, some residents ignore these regulations, leaving unwanted surprises on sidewalks during morning commutes. The prevalent dog waste is particularly bothersome, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial city motto, displayed on the back of a building that simultaneously serves as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, and strip club - operating on the edge of legality for at least half of these ventures - is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this represents a nostalgic plea to remember Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less renowned and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it serves as an inviting call - come to Portland, where being called weird is actually a compliment.\n\nDespite the influx of wealthy Californians and the endless construction of condominiums to house them, Portland maintains its peculiarity. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what's typically rejected elsewhere. We still have modern conveniences and contemporary struggles - like the rest of America, we source most of our goods from China. While there are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, Portland has its share of normalcy too, with its yoga practitioners, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird simply means we take it all less seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrantly colored houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and \"free boxes\" during summer months. These free boxes - traditionally cardboard containers but sometimes plastic bags or crates - hold something magical: items that surprisingly often become perfect treasures for passersby. While typically containing clothes and books, they might hold anything.\n\nThis magical potential of discovering something while walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies Portland's essence - at least to me, though I'm just one variety of weird among thousands. Some of my neighbors would never consider selecting clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, actual yoga with real goats) or attending Timbers matches (our soccer team). Portland brims with people passionate about various pursuits, whether actively chasing their dreams or contemplating them over one too many drinks at the bar.\n\nIndeed, Portland faces its challenges - drug problems (often rooted in mental health issues, potentially exacerbated by our persistently rainy, cloudy weather) and homelessness. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services, though like everywhere else in the country, these services remain inadequate. The housed population oscillates between compassion and contempt - and in this regard, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains remain eternal. In the north, they witness the sun's path every morning and evening. No matter how much I might forget them or become entangled in work and life's demands, they stand there - unwavering, unchallenged, and unmoved by life's trials. On my most stressful and tense days, they command attention, and when I turn to face them, they allow my troubled soul to find peace, lending me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus immediately captured my heart. While the university itself offers stunning sights with its buildings, ponds, and trees - all of which hold a special place in my heart - it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The town itself possesses its own unique beauty. Countless cafés stand as testament to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown immerses you in an atmosphere of antiquity, with weathered, colored bricks adorning restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town pulses with the energy of its urban neighbor. This vibrancy doesn't extend far though, as one can quickly retreat to the peaceful small-town atmosphere past the library. This contrast of environments so close together gives the city a magical quality, inviting exploration. It's easy to collect precious memories here, each tied to a different corner of town. From late-night walks past rusty park swings with friends after pulling all-nighters, to rushing through the bustling downtown to catch a showing at the elegant theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like any place in life, it also harbors difficult memories. The ponds, particularly, serve both for reflection and tearful moments during late-night existential crises - the latter being something I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their purposeful lives, I often questioned my own place in life's grand puzzle. So I walked beyond the pond, past the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. There, the sun cast its brilliant light over the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I gazed at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as always - the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky, towering above all other structures on the horizon, wordlessly inspiring my resilience.",
            "At first glance, you might miss it - it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect to find places to live. At least, not places where most people would choose to make their home. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and past the hotels that only see annual occupants save for summer family reunions, and you'll discover a thriving community. Within these neighborhoods, along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes - arranged meticulously like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and lined up along the road. The first apartment complex you encounter has made headlines for some questionable activities, so we'll skip past that - appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes reveal an entirely different world, one that few local residents know exists. Facing these buildings stands a community college satellite campus - a quiet collection of buildings keeping watch over the street, where drowsy students arrive with coffee in hand at 7 AM to begin their day. Iron gates creak open to welcome them one by one, while frustrated commuters gesture and grumble about traffic delays on busy days. The street intersects with another residential road, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries on the other. The center features welcoming porch furniture and a languid ceiling fan that stirs the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the street, turning cartwheels across the spiky grass while bees drift between roadside flowers. Retired seniors walk their dogs along the path, frowning at skateboarding teenagers and politely acknowledging groups of teenage girls gathered near the playground, sharing gossip about boys and trending YouTube stars. A strip mall by the park houses an affordable sushi restaurant that's never too crowded, a pool supply store, and a nail salon. You could simultaneously prepare for pool season, get your nails done, and enjoy hibachi chicken - the convenience of strip mall life. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop where you often see park teenagers clutching sweating cups topped with various toppings while attempting skateboard tricks and vaping, believing it makes them look cool. This neighborhood represents a slice of Americana - a fragment of history in the unhurried South where even time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is fascinating. Most houses are single-family homes, though some have been divided into two units while remaining connected. My house has a modest front yard and a narrow driveway on its left side. Like most others, it reminds one of an era when suburban living embodied the American dream. This dream once united the people of this nation, but now it's fading. Yet my neighborhood and many others endure, still testifying that the dream lives on.\n\nThe residents aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the small yards aren't maintained quite like before, but every driveway still holds a car or two, and children still play as if their immediate surroundings were their entire universe. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire hope in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full of life. Each house looks different, yet somehow feels the same.\n\nThere's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family - perhaps the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, with children playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Most neighbors have lived here for generations, sharing stories of times when everyone knew everyone else.\n\nA former karate school has become a pharmacy - a sign of changing times. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at reduced prices, avoided by youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents seeking an affordable night out. A single expressway passes through our town, though the exits are in the neighboring community. A past petition for our own exit was defeated when elders convinced the city council it would harm the town's character.\n\nAs we build a new high school and debate a town mascot, I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would perfectly capture our community's essence - a blend of tradition and transformation.",
            "Living in a major city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly randomly among commercial districts, where various businesses operate. Some of these establishments consist of offices, while others are various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new dining options or shopping opportunities. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by major corporations, small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular. These aren't just found in various shopping malls, but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful and tranquil if not for their proximity to so many points of interest.\n\nThere are several nearby parks, which I've noticed are frequently visited by people with young children. Speaking of people, there's remarkable diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Extending slightly beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are many more people of various ethnicities and backgrounds, though they sometimes form their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, and many others, all just a few miles away.\n\nHowever, even a few miles can mean a lengthy journey. A mere 10-mile trip can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Despite some destinations being nearby, few people walk anywhere in my city. The city's vast size makes foot travel impractical for most residents. Consequently, we experience some of the world's worst traffic congestion, and parking is a constant challenge nearly everywhere.\n\nIronically, recent years have seen extensive construction, particularly of large apartment complexes. While the city appears to be a popular destination, many current residents are concerned about the prospect of more people moving in and additional vehicles on the roads. However, housing in my city is diverse. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of various sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes.\n\nThis variety extends to my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. The community includes people of all ages, though truthfully, I'm not acquainted with most of my neighbors. While it's not particularly close-knit nowadays, I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and other neighborhood friends who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we passed the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she would be shocked by the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, she had never witnessed such expansive space in her life. Overwhelmed by the endless cornfields, I shared stories of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Following a two-lane country road, you'll find a water-filled quarry, and just beyond it lies the small development I call home. The houses, primarily built of brick and stucco, each sit on at least half an acre of meticulously maintained land. Spring brings an abundance of annual flowers alongside Midwestern trees that transform with each season. Driveways showcase gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles, freshly washed and sparkling in the midday sun. Along the road to my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor can always be found outside, wearing a friendly smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn, singing over the mower's drone. While the neighborhood finds him amusing, he remains genuine and remarkable, with a fascinating history. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, this former doctor blends seamlessly with his surroundings and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. At my home, geese populate the side yard, perpetually pursued by our Terrier. The backyard features a small stream flowing into the quarry, where bullfrogs, running water, and occasional moos from nearby farms create a pastoral symphony. Beyond a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers - my childhood playground. From constructing tree forts to chasing wildlife, adventure always awaited, usually shared with neighborhood friends. Though winters here can be ruthlessly harsh, they possess their own beauty. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness, and trees once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange blossoms become bare silhouettes. Snowfall creates overnight wonderlands, where my sister's snow angels and snowmen line the backyard. Our childhood rivalries often played out in winter warfare, with snowballs as ammunition and elaborate fort-arsenals built from snow and branches. In this magical realm, we lived out our make-believe adventures, carefree children in a world where nothing else mattered."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan, where farmland transitions into small tourist towns. There are no large shopping malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You need to drive wherever you want to go. Nevertheless, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is embraced by water - the magnificent Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. You can find a beach to dip your toes in wherever you go.\n\nMy neighborhood embodies small-town life. The houses aren't cramped together or cookie-cutter designs. They're older homes, some renovated and remodeled, others maintaining their original character. Most have full basements visible from the street, and many sport vintage aluminum siding. The houses in our area come in every imaginable color. Most properties have yards with trampolines and play equipment. Some residents maintain gardens and have fenced areas for their pets.\n\nThese homes reflect Middle America - hardworking people making a living, either raising families or having already raised them. Children play in the streets daily, while people walk their dogs, bike, and rollerblade. Neighbors know each other, and you can tell who belongs and who doesn't. You'll exchange waves with someone grilling outdoors or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from a few blocks away.\n\nThe properties are well-maintained, with no leftover autumn leaves, neatly mowed lawns, and trimmed bushes and plants. While it's not a neighborhood that makes you gasp at luxurious homes, it's one that suggests \"this is a good place to raise a family.\" It's peaceful, quiet, and secure - though average in appearance, it exemplifies what people want: a safe haven at day's end.\n\nWithin walking distance, you'll find the county sheriff's department and jail, the health department next door, and the city recycling center down the road, which serves the whole community. Nearby baseball and softball fields fill the air with the sound of announcers calling games. Our small town airport provides the backdrop of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to the local ice cream shop, and ambitious walkers can reach downtown. My children can bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is an wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I live can be characterized as a typical, uniformly designed suburb. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association (HOA) is very noticeable. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but meticulously maintained single-family homes, which we can attribute to the HOA. The front yards share a striking similarity - each featuring a modest patch of manicured lawn, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Small trees dot the landscape occasionally. Every home has a two-car garage.\n\nThroughout the neighborhood, you'll find freshly paved roads in pristine condition, with no signs of deterioration or potholes despite the numerous families residing here. While most houses are single-story, you'll occasionally encounter two-story homes. Our mail delivery system differs from the traditional setup - instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have centralized mail stations at the end of each street, similar to apartment complexes. Each resident has a key to access their designated mailbox, and there are two larger compartments for packages - another example of the HOA's preference for uniformity.\n\nOur location on the city's outskirts creates an interesting blend of rural and suburban living. The neighborhood boasts extensive amenities, including multiple well-maintained, gated community pools accessible to all residents. There are various walking trails perfect for dog walking or evening strolls. The neighborhood's size eliminates the need for a separate exercise venue - you can get plenty of physical activity just by running within the community.\n\nThe demographic primarily consists of retirees, with a smaller mixture of middle-aged residents and young professionals. It's a secure area where neighbors look out for each other. The city itself is surprisingly populous while maintaining a small-town atmosphere. We have access to most modern convenities, including a modest but functional mall. Most destinations require about 15 minutes of driving, but once there, you'll find numerous shopping options ranging from upscale organic grocery stores to budget-friendly outlets with minimal staffing to keep prices low.\n\nOverall, our neighborhood embodies safety, good maintenance, and typical suburban living. While we may not be immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive provides access to any major retail chain you might need, and we enjoy excellent amenities like community pools and walking trails.",
            "The first time I heard about my place was through a podcast about missing persons. It was somewhat surprising. Nearly every apartment in the area was renting for over a thousand dollars monthly. I had never heard anything about that story, and neither had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Life is expensive, but we've learned to be thrifty over the years. You grow to appreciate the musty scent of flea market finds and second-hand clothes. Your sense of smell dulls in adulthood. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just become numb to how things are. But the flea market always makes its presence known. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and stays even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is packed, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but you'd never know it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or vehicles pass by, the store remains silent. It's a perfect place to while away an afternoon. Each year brings more of those crowds. Cars and people flood in. They call it a developing city. Home to one of the largest online retail and delivery empires, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone focuses on their own goals, and nobody asks much of you. You can be solitary, quiet, and independent, and people respect that. Unlike the South, where showing concern is a sign of caring, people here don't intrude into others' lives. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city ebbs and flows like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to live. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we're less a building of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together when needed, celebrate birthdays, share in grief, and help each other when possible. I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. We exchange mail deliveries. It's pleasant seeing them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. Though I live in an enormous, impersonal modern urban sprawl, it's people like my neighbors who make me feel I haven't completely derailed my life.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town located just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood on the east side could be considered the most economically challenged area of town. Property values are low, with most houses either rented or owned by low-income residents. Nevertheless, it's neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and greet you when walking down the street. While crime rates are somewhat higher than in other parts of town, they remain generally low. There have been several violent incidents within a few blocks of my house over the past decade, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our neighbors lost their son last year in a shooting outside a local bar. Fortunately, our family has not been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. Like many parts of the United States, our town has been significantly affected by the opioid epidemic, with many lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, our town offers numerous resources to combat this crisis, including several rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, our town has many positive aspects. My son's elementary school has exceptional staff throughout, and despite his special needs, he has experienced no bullying thanks to the school's incredibly positive atmosphere. We have an active PTO organizing various events throughout the year. Given that over 20% of our population lives below the poverty line, all students receive free breakfast and lunch. No family is treated differently due to financial circumstances, and school-related costs are kept reasonable. While the City Council has made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repairs, landscaping, and park renovations, these improvements have primarily focused on the central and western areas, leaving the east side somewhat neglected - a source of frustration for our neighborhood. Overall, I find life here satisfying. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, shopping options are sufficient, and while our home may not be worth much, it's comfortable and meets our needs. After living here for over 16 years, we couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home.",
            "My neighborhood pulses with cultural diversity. Perched on a hill, it's embraced by buildings steeped in history. I reside in a seven-story apartment building opposite the historic theater, and just down The Hill lies a charming arcade bar that attracts an eclectic crowd on balmy summer evenings. Particularly during June and July weekends, you'll find people queuing to enter. A few blocks uphill sits the nearest city park, impressively sized for its urban location. The park is bordered by concrete walls with broad steps carved into them. During the harsh winter months, homeless individuals arrange their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the rain is persistent, and the winter's torrential downpours make staying warm a challenge. By clustering their tents together in the city center rather than in the outskirts, they find better warmth and remain within walking distance of the area's only family center, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat captivates me about my city isn't just its historic grandeur - the majestic buildings and varied architecture cascading down hills toward the ocean. Rather, it's the cultural fabric of its people. Hilltop was once notorious across the West Coast for gang activity. Even thirty years later, stories circulate about federal agents and DEA operations sweeping through like a cleansing tide. The community preserves these memories, passing them down through generations, even to newcomers like myself. Despite still being considered one of the city's rougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain their neighborhood's integrity.\n\nThough some warn white people against walking The Hill after dark, I see this caution as an echo of the past, tainted by social prejudice. Perhaps it's because I'm ambiguous enough not to read as entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop accepts me as one of its own - someone equally conscious of our nation's ongoing struggles with racism, cultural bias, and fear-based assumptions, even in a supposedly progressive urban melting pot.\n\nOne thing remains certain: Hilltop is home, regardless of where life takes me. These streets pulse with life at night, where I've encountered more people offering me protection than threat. It's where laundromat owners extend their hours to shelter someone from the rain, where strangers recognize humanity in those who feel invisible, offering not just money but dignity and hope.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, I struggled to make friends, but I eventually became close with someone who lived two houses down and another boy from my street. Neither of them lives there anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved in are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. On weekends or when it's warm, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had problems with any neighbors. People here leave you alone unless you need help. I've ordered packages online many times and never had one stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There's a park just a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I used to play basketball, football, and baseball there with other boys from the neighborhood. I also experienced one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose during football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. These days, I only go there with my cousin's children. They're much younger than me and still enjoy swings, slides, and things like that. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park makes me nostalgic for many different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within about a mile radius, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered. The most popular places are fast-food restaurants, but you can find those near almost any suburban neighborhood. There are also many pizzerias. The stores here have everything you might need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There's both a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, as well as a Jewel-Osco supermarket, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are multicultural, like an Indian store if you want to make homemade Indian food or buy ready-made Indian dishes. Overall, I really like my neighborhood. When I read about horror stories others have with their neighbors on social media and in the news, I'm grateful for mine.",
            "I live near the college I attend, which makes it a really enjoyable place for me. The area is dominated by apartment buildings, with several reasonably priced restaurants and bars scattered throughout. One bar recently underwent a name change - it's a bit pricier now, but the service and drinks are still decent. The community is mostly friendly, consisting of college students and working-class residents, given the affordable housing options. There are many children around because an elementary school is within walking distance. While I don't know my neighbors personally (and prefer it that way), I find it amusing that management installed an air freshener opposite their door due to their frequent cannabis use.\n\nThe surrounding buildings are generally older, though some have updated interiors. New apartments further down the street, despite their expensive rent, were poorly constructed - a clear exploitation of the campus location. There's an inexpensive restaurant nearby that serves microwaved food on paper plates, and a gas station with a reportedly poor work environment. Recent city funding improved the area with new sidewalks and landscaping, making it more attractive. My building is surrounded by trees, though some were recently removed, and there's significantly more greenery here than in other parts of the neighborhood.\n\nI'm on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street behind us, which is notably less maintained with crumbling sidewalks and run-down buildings. While there's been some criminal activity in the area, particularly in certain complexes, I'm generally satisfied with my living situation. The rent is affordable, amenities are convenient, and I especially appreciate being able to walk to the university and having easy access to public transportation for reaching stores and downtown.",
            "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac, arranged and spaced to resemble single-family homes. Their distinguishing feature is their uniform yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs. Nearly everyone here has formed friendships, creating a close-knit community. On many evenings, we gather spontaneously at the end of driveways to chat while neighborhood children play with toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's refreshing to experience this in our modern, technology-driven world - like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, complemented by blue skies and billowing white clouds.\n\nThe only drawback? This season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard actual tornado sirens that sent us seeking shelter. I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, anxious about the unusual situation, refused to leave the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood fell silent except for the sound of large hail hitting the ground. After the storm, the road literally steamed from the dramatic temperature drop - from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the hot pavement. As the skies cleared, the sun emerged while it was still raining, creating a double rainbow. I rushed to capture photos for my Facebook friends and family, who were as amazed as I was.\n\nThe streets remained quiet for an hour until people returned from their storm shelters, then life resumed its normal rhythm with mothers and children outside as dinner cooked. Having recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find this friendly neighborhood charming and love the Southern accents. While we all have two-bedroom, two-bath apartments, and the buildings look identical outside, the interior layouts vary surprisingly, with some units being quite compact. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my home to the pond (though it's not for swimming). I've spotted deer, and mornings bring the deep songs of bullfrogs. Located just forty minutes outside Charlotte, it's a fantastic place to live. Each morning begins with roosters crowing from nearby farms, creating the atmosphere of a small village community. We even have a neighborhood donkey who announces his presence with evening brays. I truly feel fortunate to have discovered this neighborhood gem.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I can share my experiences. When I first moved to this neighborhood from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was quite emotional - I'll admit I shed tears because I missed my old community dearly. My parents made this move for better opportunities for me and my sister - better housing, better schooling, and what people would consider a \"nicer\" area. Time helped me adjust, and I found both friends and rivals at school. While I didn't get to know most neighbors well over the years, Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, our immediate neighbors, became almost like family to me. I have fond memories of attending Mr. Glen's second wedding with my family. It was a joyous celebration where I even caught the garter, though the bouquet eluded me! I had a wonderful time dancing with their daughter Marsharii, whom I haven't seen since but hope is thriving wherever she is. The neighborhood itself is quite intricate, though GPS helps me explore it now. I've ventured around with my friends Kason and Curtis, spending countless hours gaming and living life to its fullest. I find peace in visiting the local park, practicing balance with my training sticks from Home Depot, and sometimes bringing my wooden bokken sword. While I haven't used them recently, having tennis and basketball courts nearby is wonderful. My father and Mr. Graves taught my best friend and me tennis - it was demanding but enjoyable. While I have many more stories about this neighborhood, these memories stand out most, and I'm confident the best is still ahead!",
            "My neighborhood is a charming small town. While it may not stand out among other towns in South Carolina, it plays a significant role in agriculture. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, as displayed on its welcome sign. The landscape is dominated by peach orchards and cattle farms. Houses outside the town center are generously spaced, typically two stories high with either metal roofs designed to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Most residences are set back from the road, leaving front fields available for livestock or crops.\n\nThe town center features a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where all local businesses are concentrated. There are three dining options: Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese establishment, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizza place once operated here but recently closed. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family-owned pharmacy, has earned local fame for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's sole grocery store, IGA (Independent Grocers Alliance), though somewhat expensive, serves mainly for quick purchases, as most residents prefer traveling to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping.\n\nDollar General is the town's busiest establishment, offering various everyday items and staying active throughout its business hours. Possibilities Furniture & More, managed by a well-respected community member, has served the town for many years, complete with delivery service. The same building houses Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering pet grooming, daycare, boarding, and related services.\n\nBoth medical and veterinary practices operate outside the town center - small but well-equipped facilities serving Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town; older students must attend middle and high school in the neighboring town. While the town currently lacks parks, there's an ongoing project to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers.\n\nThe town admittedly offers limited entertainment options, with no movie theaters, bowling alleys, social venues, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or extensive dining choices. Nevertheless, it maintains its charm as a small town - one you might miss in the blink of an eye!",
            "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, so we experience more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise it's a peaceful neighborhood. There isn't much turnover in residents, so I've become familiar with most of the people who live here. People generally keep themselves busy with yard work and daily routines. In winter, we go sledding down a hill on our side street. We live in a house on the front corner of our street, which means we see everyone coming and going throughout the day and recognize the vehicles that frequent our area. We tend to notice when unfamiliar vehicles appear. Some neighbors take walks for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and engage in typical activities you'd expect. We're home frequently since we work from here. There are four of us - my wife and I, plus our two daughters who are eleven and fourteen. Everyone knows our patterns too. We enjoy outdoor activities, even in the rain. Sometimes we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with pleasant cooking aromas. Someone's always mowing their lawn here from March through October, when the grass finally stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally wooded, has many trees providing shade, though this means plenty of leaf-raking and burning in autumn. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves - it's a wonderful sign of fall's arrival. Recently, our winters have been mild, making it feel like an extended autumn. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door except for occasional visitors. When I'm working in the garage on my truck or other projects with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are typically quiet here, though Thanksgiving brings out-of-town visitors and extra cars parked throughout the area. The same happens during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here - it would be perfect if it weren't a through street.",
            "I live in the heart of the high desert, surrounded by endless expanses of dirt. Unless you've lived here yourself, it's hard to grasp the constant presence of brown landscapes, and when you do spot a green lawn, you know its owner is investing heavily in its maintenance. When I first settled here in the 90s, houses were few and far between. While that spacing remains similar today, many new developments have sprung up. The area is increasingly taking on an urban character, though this seems to be a common trend everywhere.\n\nThe community is generally friendly, though like any populated area, it has its better and worse sections. My immediate neighborhood is filled with friendly elderly residents, suggesting it's one of the nicer areas. The local businesses are predominantly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you need to travel elsewhere, as we lack establishments like Whole Foods.\n\nConstruction appears to be the dominant industry here, though I'm not citing official statistics. This makes sense given how underdeveloped the area remains, with plenty of open space for building. This prospect concerns me somewhat, as I appreciate the current atmosphere, having left big city life behind deliberately.\n\nConstruction is actually my field of work - I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the things I most appreciate about living here is the wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for various reasons, particularly its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape have created distinctive ecosystems that require protection and host diverse wildlife. It's important for residents to understand their non-human neighbors to ensure peaceful coexistence.\n\nMy family has adapted well to desert life. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects - even now, they're outside hunting for different specimens. We have several attractions in the area, including the San Bernardino County Fair in Victorville, which offers a unique desert experience. Nearby Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports opportunities. For those interested in natural history, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that chronicle the area's development.",
            "When describing my neighborhood, I believe my response is rather unique. Unlike others who might describe traditional residential areas, my situation is somewhat different. I consider my neighborhood to be my college campus, with my dormitory community serving as my immediate community. I also view the broader campus as my extended neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this unusual circumstance, my neighborhood shares many characteristics with more traditional neighborhoods, including housing, residents, shops, and recreational areas.\n\nLet me elaborate on the housing options in my area. There are three distinct types: apartment complexes, traditional houses, and dormitories. The apartments typically accommodate 2-4 residents per unit, with 4-6 units per floor across two floors, housing approximately 20 people per building. Then there are conventional houses, available for rent to those affiliated with the university, usually occupied by alumni in 2-4 bedroom arrangements, though these are less common due to space inefficiency. The dormitories, which are most prevalent, house hundreds of students, typically with two students sharing a room.\n\nOur community takes pride in its diversity, with residents representing various cultures and age groups. Professional staff typically occupy the houses, while newer students reside in dormitories and upperclassmen tend to live in apartments. The community is too vibrant and diverse to be adequately captured in words alone.\n\nAs for amenities, our campus functions as a self-contained neighborhood with numerous shops and a central park. The retail options include various dining establishments similar to any traditional neighborhood, along with university-branded clothing stores and grocery outlets, ensuring all essential needs are met within our boundaries. Our park serves as a communal gathering space for our diverse population, maintained and secured through the collective effort of all community members.",
            "There are hardly any sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downhill, and my house sits right at the peak of the neighborhood's steepest hill. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many joggers enjoy running up it during their daily exercise. Since there are no sidewalks at all on my street, everyone walks on the road. The road is pockmarked in places and can feel somewhat treacherous to drive on. Some of the telephone and power lines around the area look tattered. Our area gets frequent rain and storms, so branches and other debris often damage the power lines, and the constant repairs give them a patchwork appearance. Tall evergreen trees are everywhere you look, but locals dislike them because they block the ocean view. That's why many houses are built high on the hill, with large glass-fronted second floors that rise one after another to capture the bay view. It's spectacular at sunset when the water appears to glow from beneath and the sky turns orange. However, it's usually cloudy, so most sunlight filters through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp, with moss growing on everything - roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned, it had become green and fuzzy with moss, taking three hours to scrape clean. There aren't many children in my area, despite a school being just blocks away. Most residents are older, many retired. Instead of children, people have dogs, which you often see lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door or window open, and you might find one wandering into your house - I once found one in my living room and had to guide it back out. Wild rabbits roam the area, much to gardeners' dismay as they damage plant roots and burrow into lawns. My cats, however, love them and have hunted most from our neighborhood. We get typical birds: sparrows and hummingbirds, with occasional hawks or eagles that get chased away by local crows. While there are no stores nearby, a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals several restaurants serving fresh seafood. Though there's little beach, the shoreline rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay isn't very wide - you can clearly see the opposite shore even through the typical mist.",
            "If you're planning to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it! Public transit is readily available and remains one of the most popular ways to get around New York City. Bensonhurst maintains an urban character that makes you feel very much part of New York City. During your visit, expect to see numerous Asian businesses throughout the area. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has welcomed a significant Asian population. As a result, you'll find Asian-owned businesses on practically every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are particularly common, and these establishments are highly popular with locals due to their excellent food quality, competitive prices, and convenient locations. In my immediate vicinity alone, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking radius.\n\nHowever, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian – it's quite multicultural, home to immigrants and their first and second-generation American children. While many prominent local businesses are Asian-owned, the neighborhood also features a newly renovated park with ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playground equipment, and a splash pad for children to enjoy during summer. True to New York City's character, the parks reflect the area's diversity, with people of all backgrounds harmoniously sharing the space.\n\nThe neighborhood lacks major corporate buildings, featuring mainly co-op buildings, condominiums, and predominantly two-family houses. While most residents are friendly, noise can be an issue – expect to hear cars with loud music and revving engines, even in the early morning. Evening visitors should remain vigilant. Though generally safe, the neighborhood has its share of troublemakers, bullies, and thieves. I personally experienced bullying here years ago, and package theft remains an ongoing concern. Additionally, despite city fines for not cleaning up after dogs, some residents ignore these regulations, leaving unwanted surprises on sidewalks during morning commutes. The prevalent dog waste is particularly bothersome, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial city motto, displayed on the back of a building that simultaneously serves as a pizzeria, bar, music venue, and strip club - operating on the edge of legality for at least half of these ventures - is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this represents a nostalgic plea to remember Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less renowned and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it serves as an inviting call - come to Portland, where being called weird is actually a compliment.\n\nDespite the influx of wealthy Californians and the endless construction of condominiums to house them, Portland maintains its peculiarity. Being weird doesn't always mean being accepting, but it does mean embracing what's typically rejected elsewhere. We still have modern conveniences and contemporary struggles - like the rest of America, we source most of our goods from China. While there are countless ways to be weird or unconventional, Portland has its share of normalcy too, with its yoga practitioners, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird simply means we take it all less seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrantly colored houses, home gardens bursting with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and \"free boxes\" during summer months. These free boxes - traditionally cardboard containers but sometimes plastic bags or crates - hold something magical: items that surprisingly often become perfect treasures for passersby. While typically containing clothes and books, they might hold anything.\n\nThis magical potential of discovering something while walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood embodies Portland's essence - at least to me, though I'm just one variety of weird among thousands. Some of my neighbors would never consider selecting clothes from a sidewalk box. They prefer goat yoga (yes, actual yoga with real goats) or attending Timbers matches (our soccer team). Portland brims with people passionate about various pursuits, whether actively chasing their dreams or contemplating them over one too many drinks at the bar.\n\nIndeed, Portland faces its challenges - drug problems (often rooted in mental health issues, potentially exacerbated by our persistently rainy, cloudy weather) and homelessness. The homeless population is drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services, though like everywhere else in the country, these services remain inadequate. The housed population oscillates between compassion and contempt - and in this regard, we're not weird at all.",
            "The mountains remain eternal. In the north, they witness the sun's path every morning and evening. No matter how much I might forget them or become entangled in work and life's demands, they stand there - unwavering, unchallenged, and unmoved by life's trials. On my most stressful and tense days, they command attention, and when I turn to face them, they allow my troubled soul to find peace, lending me strength to continue, one day at a time. I first arrived here during my undergraduate studies, and the mountains north of campus immediately captured my heart. While the university itself offers stunning sights with its buildings, ponds, and trees - all of which hold a special place in my heart - it's the mountains that truly reign supreme. The town itself possesses its own unique beauty. Countless cafés stand as testament to many hours of caffeine-fueled studying. A short walk or bus ride to downtown immerses you in an atmosphere of antiquity, with weathered, colored bricks adorning restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town pulses with the energy of its urban neighbor. This vibrancy doesn't extend far though, as one can quickly retreat to the peaceful small-town atmosphere past the library. This contrast of environments so close together gives the city a magical quality, inviting exploration. It's easy to collect precious memories here, each tied to a different corner of town. From late-night walks past rusty park swings with friends after pulling all-nighters, to rushing through the bustling downtown to catch a showing at the elegant theater with university-provided tickets. Yet, like any place in life, it also harbors difficult memories. The ponds, particularly, serve both for reflection and tearful moments during late-night existential crises - the latter being something I know well. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their purposeful lives, I often questioned my own place in life's grand puzzle. So I walked beyond the pond, past the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. There, the sun cast its brilliant light over the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I gazed at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. And there they were, as always - the mighty mountains touching the hazy blue and yellow sky, towering above all other structures on the horizon, wordlessly inspiring my resilience.",
            "At first glance, you might miss it - it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not somewhere you'd expect to find places to live. At least, not places where most people would choose to make their home. But venture behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and past the hotels that only see annual occupants save for summer family reunions, and you'll discover a thriving community. Within these neighborhoods, along these streets, you'll find several apartment complexes - arranged meticulously like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully dismantled and lined up along the road. The first apartment complex you encounter has made headlines for some questionable activities, so we'll skip past that - appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes reveal an entirely different world, one that few local residents know exists. Facing these buildings stands a community college satellite campus - a quiet collection of buildings keeping watch over the street, where drowsy students arrive with coffee in hand at 7 AM to begin their day. Iron gates creak open to welcome them one by one, while frustrated commuters gesture and grumble about traffic delays on busy days. The street intersects with another residential road, bordered by a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from injuries on the other. The center features welcoming porch furniture and a languid ceiling fan that stirs the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the street, turning cartwheels across the spiky grass while bees drift between roadside flowers. Retired seniors walk their dogs along the path, frowning at skateboarding teenagers and politely acknowledging groups of teenage girls gathered near the playground, sharing gossip about boys and trending YouTube stars. A strip mall by the park houses an affordable sushi restaurant that's never too crowded, a pool supply store, and a nail salon. You could simultaneously prepare for pool season, get your nails done, and enjoy hibachi chicken - the convenience of strip mall life. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop where you often see park teenagers clutching sweating cups topped with various toppings while attempting skateboard tricks and vaping, believing it makes them look cool. This neighborhood represents a slice of Americana - a fragment of history in the unhurried South where even time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood is fascinating. Most houses are single-family homes, though some have been divided into two units while remaining connected. My house has a modest front yard and a narrow driveway on its left side. Like most others, it reminds one of an era when suburban living embodied the American dream. This dream once united the people of this nation, but now it's fading. Yet my neighborhood and many others endure, still testifying that the dream lives on.\n\nThe residents aren't as optimistic as they once were, and the small yards aren't maintained quite like before, but every driveway still holds a car or two, and children still play as if their immediate surroundings were their entire universe. The public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire hope in today's youth while evoking nostalgia in older residents. Churches are sparse and mostly empty, but the basketball courts remain full of life. Each house looks different, yet somehow feels the same.\n\nThere's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family - perhaps the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are wide, with children playing football, pausing only for passing cars. Most neighbors have lived here for generations, sharing stories of times when everyone knew everyone else.\n\nA former karate school has become a pharmacy - a sign of changing times. There's also a small movie theater showing classic films at reduced prices, avoided by youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents seeking an affordable night out. A single expressway passes through our town, though the exits are in the neighboring community. A past petition for our own exit was defeated when elders convinced the city council it would harm the town's character.\n\nAs we build a new high school and debate a town mascot, I believe a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would perfectly capture our community's essence - a blend of tradition and transformation.",
            "Living in a major city, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential areas are scattered seemingly randomly among commercial districts, where various businesses operate. Some of these establishments consist of offices, while others are various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There's no shortage of new dining options or shopping opportunities. While some stores are large, well-known brands owned by major corporations, small boutiques are becoming increasingly popular. These aren't just found in various shopping malls, but also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be peaceful and tranquil if not for their proximity to so many points of interest.\n\nThere are several nearby parks, which I've noticed are frequently visited by people with young children. Speaking of people, there's remarkable diversity in my neighborhood. In one small area, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Extending slightly beyond my immediate neighborhood, there are many more people of various ethnicities and backgrounds, though they sometimes form their own distinct communities within the city. We have areas known as Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, and many others, all just a few miles away.\n\nHowever, even a few miles can mean a lengthy journey. A mere 10-mile trip can take up to two hours due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Despite some destinations being nearby, few people walk anywhere in my city. The city's vast size makes foot travel impractical for most residents. Consequently, we experience some of the world's worst traffic congestion, and parking is a constant challenge nearly everywhere.\n\nIronically, recent years have seen extensive construction, particularly of large apartment complexes. While the city appears to be a popular destination, many current residents are concerned about the prospect of more people moving in and additional vehicles on the roads. However, housing in my city is diverse. Not everyone lives or wants to live in large apartment buildings. Residential areas comprise houses of various sizes, smaller apartment buildings, and condominiums. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes.\n\nThis variety extends to my immediate neighborhood, offering diverse housing options. The community includes people of all ages, though truthfully, I'm not acquainted with most of my neighbors. While it's not particularly close-knit nowadays, I have fond memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and other neighborhood friends who were around my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we passed the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she would be shocked by the vastness of the open landscape. Coming from a town where the grocery store was just a 5-minute walk from her house, she had never witnessed such expansive space in her life. Overwhelmed by the endless cornfields, I shared stories of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she truly understood who I was and where I came from. Following a two-lane country road, you'll find a water-filled quarry, and just beyond it lies the small development I call home. The houses, primarily built of brick and stucco, each sit on at least half an acre of meticulously maintained land. Spring brings an abundance of annual flowers alongside Midwestern trees that transform with each season. Driveways showcase gleaming Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles, freshly washed and sparkling in the midday sun. Along the road to my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor can always be found outside, wearing a friendly smile. He spends his days mowing his lawn, singing over the mower's drone. While the neighborhood finds him amusing, he remains genuine and remarkable, with a fascinating history. Though age has dulled some of his sharpness, this former doctor blends seamlessly with his surroundings and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. At my home, geese populate the side yard, perpetually pursued by our Terrier. The backyard features a small stream flowing into the quarry, where bullfrogs, running water, and occasional moos from nearby farms create a pastoral symphony. Beyond a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers - my childhood playground. From constructing tree forts to chasing wildlife, adventure always awaited, usually shared with neighborhood friends. Though winters here can be ruthlessly harsh, they possess their own beauty. The lush green yard transforms into a stark wilderness, and trees once adorned with vibrant pink, purple, and orange blossoms become bare silhouettes. Snowfall creates overnight wonderlands, where my sister's snow angels and snowmen line the backyard. Our childhood rivalries often played out in winter warfare, with snowballs as ammunition and elaborate fort-arsenals built from snow and branches. In this magical realm, we lived out our make-believe adventures, carefree children in a world where nothing else mattered."
