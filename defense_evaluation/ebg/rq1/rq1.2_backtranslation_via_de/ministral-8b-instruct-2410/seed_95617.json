            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In pursuing a career in social work, I intend to follow a path in the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support for troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical behavior, commitment to improving relationships between others and to continually improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others but was unsure of the career path I wanted to take. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals fleeing from their problems through denial and some using coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Due to the situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent's residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents' house. There, I privately expressed my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was nothing the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and made excuses for their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in involving external sources to resolve \"simple\" disputes. After this experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother value important in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and mourn those who have been lost. The concept of the \"individual\" held by society is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like \"everyone else\"? I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to conform to others. Throughout my years in high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: by coloring my hair unnaturally, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "The following paper examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on inherited genetic information as well as medical aspects of health. The sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each selected study to better relate to and explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then criticized to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are dyssomnias or parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of substances. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is a difficulty in achieving or maintaining adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons that are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that animal models of mice can be generalized to human studies. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could alter the ability to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and everyday events that involve monotonous tasks and focus.",
            "Dieser Artikel deckt drei Bereiche des Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) ab. Zunächst wird eine kurze Definition der Erkrankung gegeben. Anschließend wird die Diagnose erklärt, einschließlich der häufigen Merkmale oder \"roten Fahnen\". Abschließend werden Wege beschrieben, wie ein Lehrer in einer inklusiven Klassensituation einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nCAPD, auch Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) genannt, bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditive Informationen verarbeitet. Enger definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung auditativer Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und zu elektrischen auditiven Potentialen führt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Erkrankung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem, also das Gehirn, normal gesprochene Dinge nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normal, sind also nicht als \"hörbehindert\" einzustufen; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der die gehörten Dinge analysiert und erkennt, nicht wie üblich.\n\nDie frühesten Erwähnungen der Erkrankung, die später als CAPD bekannt wurde, stammen aus den 1950er Jahren und wurden als \"auditory imperception\" bezeichnet (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine italienische Forschungsgruppe aus Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura die dichotische Testung und ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS ein, das der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz im Jahr 1977 förderte die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD.\n\nCAPD zeigt sich in verschiedenen Formen: Betroffene können Schwierigkeiten haben, Geräusche räumlich einzuordnen oder zu hören; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, zwei oder mehr \"akustische Ereignisse\" (Geräuschereignisse) zu unterscheiden; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, Muster in Geräuschen zu erkennen; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, Sprachänderungen zu erkennen (wie z.B. das Erkennen von Ironie durch Änderung der Stimme); ein Geräusch kann durch ein folgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; sie könnten Schwierigkeiten haben, auditive Hinweise zu interpretieren und darauf zu reagieren; und sie könnten Schwierigkeiten haben, die Reihenfolge der auditiven Informationen zu bestimmen (Ferre).\n\nZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient systematisch auf sein Hörverhalten und/oder seine Leistung bei Tests der auditiven Funktion überprüft werden. Dies kann von Audiologen, Logopäden, Psychologen und anderen durchgeführt werden, die eine Vielzahl von Maßnahmen verwenden, um auditive Fähigkeiten zu bewerten. Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung auditiver Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktionen auf bestimmte Reize, gehören. Es gibt derzeit kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, das mit hoher Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit konsistent verwendet wird, und die Ursache der Erkrankung ist unbekannt. Viele verwendete Tests stellen dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitig vorliegende auditive Reize vor und fragen nach der Unterscheidung bestimmter Elemente wie einer Serie von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittene Tests umfassen die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to suggest that while disguise can indeed be useful for prolonged deception, in the end one must reject this newly assumed guise or risk losing oneself entirely. The problem with ending a deception, however, is that it may leave one feeling isolated. Therefore, in the end, one must choose between self-preservation and preserving relationships with those around them. While some may respond neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others will not take it lightly and may be offended by the whole charade.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender reversal is particularly problematic as it raises many secondary issues, with the most significant question being: Why? Why does one feel the need to shirk their own identity and take on a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is obviously a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Not only that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception can facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages hint that these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia secretly harbor feelings for women? One could argue that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those of his time who judge others solely based on their appearance.\n\nThis is evident in how easily Olivia switches her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "Compared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters, most if not all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, which was then followed by sub-sub-genres, and the chain continues until today.\n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70’s that led to people getting crazier, leading to them to make crazy, other-worldly records, using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down, supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they put that song on The White Album.",
            "Before one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.",
            "Viele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer grundlegenden Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seinem Gedicht „Ode on a Grecian Urn“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit ist Schönheit – das ist alles, was auf Erden bekannt ist und alles, was man wissen muss.“ Vieles, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Dennoch scheinen wir Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, wie Keats andeutet, ohne sie auf diese Weise zu lernen. Beide, Ethik und Ästhetik, sind Versuche, zu beschreiben, nicht zu vorschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind in der Regel Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt ein Regelwerk zum Beurteilen oder Schaffen guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens zu sein.\nRelevanter noch: Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann nie vollständig das Wesentliche von Gutem oder Schönem erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert des Mona Lisa von da Vinci, zum Beispiel, könnte sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturelle Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Vielmehr, wenn man nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literaturwerk gefragt wird, ist es üblich, eine Phrase wie „Es gibt einfach etwas daran“ zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nicht vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Weise, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann … man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Erklärung unzureichend wäre.“ Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, es bleibt immer etwas Transzendentale. Ich glaube, dass Ethik ebenfalls diese Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. / . Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses ‚etwas‘, dieses Je ne sais quoi, ist, das die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir sie beide am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, um einen kantischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf einer Ebene, die erlebt werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie Robert McKean sagt: „Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was sie einzigartig macht, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es könnte sein, dass moralische Standards anderen Künsten wie der Musik nicht angemessen sind, aber sie scheinen so relevant für die Literatur wie für das Leben selbst zu sein. Leben notwendigerweise Werte zu integrieren …. Literatur ist uns wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir suchen.“",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful force, a unified country with a unique culture that can be felt from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is also evident in Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinct culture, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, has originated from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that it came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously called Germans before crossing the Rhine and battling the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars to distinguish between those he conquered (the Gauls) and those he didn't. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it comes from the Gaulish word for a neighbor, or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that \"I regard them [the Germans] as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet, at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and occasionally lead land campaigns but mostly returned to their sprawling empire. As Germanic tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army.

            "I looked down, mind blankly comprehending the scene in front of me. Unemotionally, silently, I studied the object with practiced awareness, refusing to relate it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flickered into my mind and dissipated almost faster than they appeared. My consciousness worked so smoothly that it seemed I had no thoughts of my own, just a liquid experience of what I was observing.\nOnce, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw since I was six and this book teaches everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wants to study. Thus, a complex picture like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room is transformed into a simple, easily grasped image.\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was so overwhelmed, so awestruck that I could only stand and gaze in wonder. Picasso went through his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters used a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of considering my perspective artistic, before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\nMy fingertips touched my chosen artistic tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will taking shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Matter flakes broke away from the whole and dissipated into nothingness. Muscles tightened, twitching and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand hit the toilet handle again. The offensive brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom.\nMop loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for the bath cleanup crew at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments, then my hand reached for the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping it tightly until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing tall, then bending at the waist, my hand slipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenager sterben hinter dem Steuer. Verschiedene Faktoren kommen zusammen und ergeben eine tödliche Statistik für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer. Das Nationale Institut für Gesundheit erklärt, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Teenagerhirn einfach nicht für die Gefahren des Fahrens bereit ist. Einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt auch am Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate an Überschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Straßenabfahrten.\n\nTeens haben es auch weit schwerer, wenn sie mit ihren Gleichaltrigen unterwegs sind – etwas, das jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center hat eine Studie durchgeführt, die die folgende Korrelation gezeigt hat: die Altersgruppe der Mitfahrer und die Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\n\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit der Teenagerfahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie eine provisorische Lizenz einführen, die die Fahrzeiten und die Mitfahrt von anderen Minderjährigen beschränkt.\n\nDiese provisorischen Fahrerlaubnisse sind jedoch, wie ich denke, nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem besteht darin, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe nach allen statistischen Indikatoren die Risiken und Verantwortungen nicht ausreichend bewältigen können. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 Jahre zu jung für eine reguläre Fahrerlaubnis ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungsergebnisse veröffentlicht hat, die einen Wunsch unter den 19-20-Jährigen zeigen, Risiken für den reinen Kick aus dem Gefühl des Risikos einzugehen. Es macht daher Sinn, das Fahren mindestens bis zu dem Zeitpunkt zu verzögern, an dem der Wunsch nach Risikoerfahrungen nachgelassen hat. Wenn wir weiterhin Fahrerlaubnisse an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Todesopferzahl wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich in erschreckenden Ausmaßen steigen. Bis 2010 werden die Kinder der Baby-Boomer Generation das Fahrtziel erreichen, und Millionen neuer Teenagerfahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\n\nGesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre angemessen einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulkurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Motorfahrzeug führen. Eine vorläufige Erlaubnis könnte weiterhin vor der Ausstellung einer vollständigen Fahrerlaubnis ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden wäre weiterhin erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Grundlage der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Bundesstaaten gefordert wird (in Kalifornien beträgt diese Anzahl derzeit 6 Stunden praktische Fahrzeit und 50 Stunden mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken der Teenagerfahrer auf einer Vielzahl von Bundesstaaten basieren, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema eine vernünftige – und ich glaube, auch wirksame – Maßnahme, um Teenager in ganz Amerika zu schützen.\n\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.",
            "In examining the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outliers present in a few of the later films. For the most part, trick films at the turn of the century were stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, featured no camera movement, used long and medium shots, and adhered to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are a few films from the early 20th century that dared to break these guidelines by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable common aspects of trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This was borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups do not occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be composed of several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Take a close look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor von Caroline war ein früher und eifriger Befürworter des Republikanismus. Trotz seiner Haupttätigkeit als Landwirt, die gemeinsam mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere dazu führte, dass er als ein Mann bekannt wurde, der sich leidenschaftlich für persönliche Freiheit und Regierung einsetzte. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Ansichten über die Regierung. Es war sein Bestreben, das, was er für die vorzüglichste aller Berufe hielt, zu bewahren und zu fördern, das seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Rechtssystem färbte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu entwickeln, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was die Schaffung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängen – das bedeutet, dass, wenn einem verweigert wird, dann alle scheitern und der Wert der verbleibenden erschüttert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige als „Naturzustand“ bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen, die über körperliche Stärke und böse Intelligenz verfügten, profitierten, aber in einer Zivilisation sollte dies nicht der Fall sein.\n\nUm dieses ideale Gesellschaftssystem zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung entwickelt werden müsse, die die intrinsische Gutheit und Bösartigkeit des Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr strikt in seinen Ansichten zu einer dualistischen Moral. Er sagte: „Da die Regierung durch den Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein“ (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und Kapitalismus abschrecken. Er glaubte, dass eine in guten Prinzipien gegründete Regierung fair funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Administration, die zwangsläufig von Habgier und Eigennutz geprägt wäre. Eigennutz, so glaubte er, ist der Antrieb des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber er wird nur böse, wenn er sich von der Schaffung einer auf dem öffentlichen Wohl basierenden Gesellschaft zu Subgesellschaften entwickelt, die auf Kosten anderer leben. Eine gute Regierung sei notwendig, um die natürliche Bosheit des Menschen in Schach zu halten, und selbst dann müsse sie unter strenger Beobachtung stehen, um das Hinzufügen schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, plädierte für eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung, der keine weiteren Rechte oder Befugnisse als die in der Verfassung ausdrücklich genannten zugestanden würden. Er wusste, dass eine ausgedehnte Bundesregierung teuer und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch wäre. Allerdings glaubte er, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich sei und ohne den Bezug auf den Willen der Schriftsteller leicht korrupt werden könne. Noch mehr, er betrachtete die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als das wahre Grundgesetz der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land klarer als eine Gruppe von souveränen Staaten als eine Nation beschreibt.",
            "Bezugnehmend auf Figur 17 gab es im dritten Monat des Projekts einen dramatischen Rückgang der Einreichungen der Pendlerprotokolle. Das war ein wenig enttäuschend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters an einer Campus im New England zeigt sich claramente ein Rückgang an Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß zur Arbeit kommen, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, in dem alle sehr beschäftigt sind, um Hausaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls könnte für viele einfach aus dem Blickfeld geraten sein. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember den Beginn der hektischen Feiertagssaison und die damit verbundene monatelange Pause für Studenten und Mitarbeiter, in der viele nicht einmal zur Campus kommen müssen. Der Unterricht beginnt dann wieder für das Frühlings Trimester Ende Januar, was möglicherweise auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl der Protokolle für diesen Monat ist. Jedoch erklärt das die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar nicht. Man könnte vermuten, dass ein Projekt dieser Art zunächst einen Anstieg an Energie und Aufregung erlebt, der dann möglicherweise natürlisch abnimmt. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die „Carpool Challenge Week“ ins Leben gerufen, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Projekt wieder zu beflügeln, was zu einer Erhöhung der Protokolleinreichungen für diesen Monat führte. Somit war eines der Herausforderungen, die wir bei diesem Projekt (oder einem alternativen Pendelprojekt) erlebten, wie man das Projektmomentum trotz eines natürlichen Rückgangs an Engagement aufrechterhält, aber auch spezifisch die Problematik von Feiertagen und Semesterpausen im Hochschulbereich. Eine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder ein alternatives Pendelprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens schätzen. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es entscheidend, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Pendelmodalitäten zu schaffen. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagesalons, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Ketten ausgegeben. Es wäre interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie größere Preise die Teilnahme beeinflusst hätten – wie zum Beispiel das Verteilen eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybride- oder Elektroautos. Das hätte auch helfen können, dem Rückgang an Engagement entgegenzuwirken, den das Projekt erlebte. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Projekts nicht. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts erhöht worden wären, das könnte geholfen haben. Die Geschenkgutscheine schienen am Anfang des Projekts völlig ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung einiger Fahrräder und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybride- oder Elektroautos angekündigt hätten, könnte man nur denken, dass das Teilnehmen und das Engagement gestiegen wäre, anstatt abzunehmen.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction.  Although these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another advantage of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\n\tTo evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, so we have decided to include only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tTo gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio were made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart, it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\n\tTo evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors.\n\nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”. The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem.\n\nGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.",

Palmer kann argumentieren, dass Martin die wahrscheinlich gefährdende Situation der Pfütze kennen musste, da sich in den Monaten vor ihrem Unfall mehrere Kund:innen von D&D durch Ausrutschen verletzt hatten; und trotz dieses Wissens die Pfütze nicht entfernt wurde. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verabscheuungswürdig waren, ist weniger überzeugend, ist aber dennoch gerechtfertigt gegeben die Fakten, dass sechs Ausrutschunghandlungen im Jahr 2009 aufgetreten sind und Martin dennoch keine angemessenen Maßnahmen ergriffen hat, um die Sicherheit seines Ladens zu gewährleisten.\n\nAm 13. Oktober 2009 um 17:00 Uhr informierte ein Mitarbeiter von D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, seinen Vorgesetzten, Paul Martin, über eine Obstmusspfütze in einem Gang. Martin sagte Wayne, dass er auf der Essenspause sei und \"keine Zeit für Kundenbeschwerden\" habe. Um 17:15 Uhr informierte ihn eine weitere Mitarbeiterin, Mary J. Haddigan, ebenfalls über die Pfütze, und Martin reagierte ähnlich. Um 17:30 Uhr am Dreizehnten rutschte die Klägerin, Jennifer Palmer, auf der Pfütze aus und erlitt eine schwere Rückenverletzung. Vor Palmers Unfall waren im Jahr 2009 fünf verschiedene Ausrutschhandlungen in D&D gemeldet worden. Palmer verklagt D&D nun auf Entschädigung und Strafschadensersatz wegen ihrer Verletzung und wir untersuchen, ob eine teilweise Zusammenfassung für den Strafschadensersatzanspruch eingereicht werden soll.\n\nIn Kalifornien kann ein Kläger für eine Pflichtverletzung, die nicht aus einem Vertrag hervorgeht, Strafschadensersatz erhalten, wenn der Beklagte \"Drangsalierung, Betrug oder Bosheit\" begangen hat. Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Die Vorschrift definiert Bosheit als Verhalten, das darauf abzielt, Schaden zu verursachen, oder bei Fehlen des Vorsatzes, dass das Verhalten \"verabscheuungswürdig\" und absichtlich und bewusst mit \"verletzungsfreudiger\" Absicht gegen die Rechte oder die Sicherheit anderer ausgeübt wird. id. bei § (c)(1). Gerichte haben Verhalten als boshaft charakterisiert, wenn es absichtlich gegen die Rechte des Klägers erfolgt ist, wenn der Beklagte \"die wahrscheinlich gefährlichen Auswirkungen seines Handelns kannte und absichtlich und vorsätzlich die Auswirkungen nicht vermieden hat\".

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally observed mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nThere are also some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of 'witness' or of how people 'on their own' converted to Islam. But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third-party perspective. That is, in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc. I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these different techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby\". Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In his novel \"The Great Gatsby\" F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and red/pink, and then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an important object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit nicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the beginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring many common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community-supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while improving habitat, thus permitting recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and other programs for generating income or educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area due to the lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often has greater costs than conventional farming. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Therefore, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "**\n\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective.",
            "Der Narr hat in seinem Herzen gesagt: „Es gibt keinen Gott.“ Dieser Gedanke erscheint erstmals im Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und ist der Beginn von St. Anselms Argumentation zur Existenz Gottes. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch der andere Autor, Thomas Aquinas, zu teilen, den wir diskutieren werden. Da beide ihre Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts vorbringen und unsere Aufgabe darin besteht, festzustellen, welche der beiden besser ist, müssen wir aus praktischen Gründen voraussetzen, dass sie beide in ihrer Überzeugung, dass es den Gott der Bibel gibt, richtig liegen. Ein Gott-Typus, der sich von dem unterscheidet, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht gestatten, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie beide im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung einer bestimmten Gottesvorstellung stehen. Es sei jedoch gesagt, dass ich glaube, dass beide Autoren zwar berechtigte Punkte bringen, aber keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\nUm dies zu veranschaulichen, untersuchen wir nun das Grundargument von St. Anselm. Anselms Passage beschreibt einen Weg der Erkenntnis durch den Glauben, indem man in sich selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass Gott in unserem Verstand existiert, sodass wir seine Nicht-Existenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während seine Argumentation in seiner Terminologie oft ermüdend und unklar ist, besteht die Hauptaussage darin, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht hinausgehen müssen über die Grenzen unserer Seele, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens in der Wahrheit liegt, die wir ohnehin innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes kennen. Außerevidenz sei angeblich nicht notwendig. Dieses Konzept, etwas zu akzeptieren, für das es keinen unbestrittenen empirischen Beleg gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\nDies ist ein sehr anderer Standpunkt als der von St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas meint, dass sich die Existenz Gottes durch reinen Verstand und empirische Beweise beweisen lässt, ohne dass Glaube notwendig ist. Eine solche Vorstellung wäre vorteilhaft für das Evangelisieren, ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Christentums, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von deren Bereitschaft, etwas Unbewiesenes zu akzeptieren, ermöglichen würde. Sie könnten stattdessen durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes beweisen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grade des Vorzugs und Harmonie. In jedem dieser Argumente zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man dir sagt, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du den Rest des Puzzles zusammenstellst, so diktiert die Logik, dass du die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Puzzleteils ohne es zu sehen kennen kannst.",
            "**\n\nSometime zwischen dem 5. und 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der später als Buddha bekannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens verließ er die Welt und erlangte Erleuchtung, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus – der am traditionellsten Orthodoxe davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddha-Zeiten. Dies zeigt sich überall, etwa in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasserritzfeier begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen daran teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nichts dergleichen gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von superfiziellen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinschaft, sowohl aus klösterlicher als auch aus layperspektiver Sicht, musste ihre doctrinalen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies kann auf innere und äußere, feindliche und wohlwollende Einflüsse zurückgeführt werden.\n\nEs gibt einige Begriffe, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Ein innerer Faktor wird als ein Faktor definiert, der von den Anhängern des Buddhismus stammt, unabhängig von ihrem status. Ein äußerer Faktor ist jeder Faktor von Nicht-Buddhisten. Ein feindlicher Faktor ist jeder Faktor, der der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder ihr schaden will – ein Faktor, der aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Ein wohlwollender Faktor ist ein Faktor, der die Buddhistengemeinde nicht schaden oder ihr helfen will, obwohl er dies möglicherweise als Nebenwirkung tut. Diese Begriffe werden im Laufe dieser Diskussion häufig vorkommen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Schutz in den drei Juwelen des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus der Tripitaka – den drei Körben – der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka die disziplinären Regeln, und der Abhidhamma Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Konzepte umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – kein Selbst, Dukkha – das Leiden im Leben, und Anicca – die Vergänglichkeit alles. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Geburt und Tod, beenden, der unaufhörlich geschieht. Mit Sansara werden auch Lobha – Gelüste, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden die Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, Ich werde nicht lügen, Ich werde nicht stehlen, Ich werde mich nicht unzüchtig verhalten und Ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinäre Regeln. Der fundamentale doctrinale Begriff in Buddhism ist der Begriff der vier heiligen Wahrheiten. Erstens Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n**",
            "The United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which were once plagued by a long-lasting rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as major conflicts of interest (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not unique; many nations have enduring rivalries with their neighbors. Nations sharing a border often have conflicting interests that lead to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are no different from many other enduring rivalries between neighboring nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American nations have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues created a divide between the two nations, a problem that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that \"if in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Not unlike the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was part ideological struggle and part competition for vital interests, the ideological struggles between the U.S. and Mexico were based on religious preferences rather than political structures. This distrust stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their former colonial rulers, which was a significant obstacle in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, revolved around territorial issues such as border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from U.S. border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both countries exerted military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and finally ended when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the nineteenth century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suddenly and unexpectedly became disabled by an illness I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply ingrained need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So – even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a little of both – I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, here I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but there is one thing that I know to be true: I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life – big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on their own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again – learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than having each of us individually scrambling out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food – do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms\", the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively static over the last ten years. While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015. The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target. That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done. In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%. The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue. While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural. This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country. Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas. Another issue of access concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\nIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child. There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results. There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period. Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "Vor ein paar Jahren arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, in dem ich Grundschüler in verschiedenen Fächern unterrichtete. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen zu helfen, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englischen und im Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen. Adrian war entweder in der dritten oder vierten Klasse und hatte große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen. Irgendwann fiel mir auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte: Er konnte einige Buchstaben perfekt aussprechen, andere aber überhaupt nicht. Er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war sicher, aber er sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich war beim Babysitten für einige wenige Kinder, während der Rest der Gruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als sie hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr begrenztem Spanisch-Kenntnissen konnten wir kommunizieren. Dann fiel es mir wie ein Schlag auf den Kopf: Adrian konnte gut lesen, aber er kannte die englische Alphabet nicht besonders gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe doch, dass es ihm besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um auf das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, einzugehen. Auch um zu zeigen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann beim Lesen noch große Schwierigkeiten haben. Ich bin sicher, dass jeder mit diesem Problem konfrontiert ist, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Lesetraining in Englisch, insbesondere das Alphabet und die Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Der Dual-Language-System, die Hauptimmersion, private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Maßnahmen allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt in der Kombination all dieser Elemente!\n\nZunächst einmal: Das Dual-Language-System ist eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in Zweisprachenschulen haben sich akademisch besser entwickelt als ihre Altersgenossen.\" Viele haben Angst vor dieser Idee, dass sie eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die meisten Kinder in der Schule davon keinen Nutzen haben. Das ist aber falsch. Wenn wir solche Programme in der Schule als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie erreichen wir das? Möchten wir alle Lehrer bilingual? Nein, das wäre unrealistisch und überfordert. Aber ich denke, es gibt keinen Grund, warum wir nicht spezialisierte Helfer und Tutoren haben könnten, die bilingual sind.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are taught that there is something out there that is greater than we are, that is beyond our comprehension. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to church or search within ourselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and adopt another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, his gaze both searching and remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely from his body. His hair was sparser than I remembered. He stared out into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months beyond the doctors’ predictions. What the value was in him merely suffering longer, I could not comprehend. What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "Die traditionelle \"Gothic Novel\" ist im Kern und im Namen ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neue,'\" wie Ian Watt es in 'The Rise of the Gothic Novel' beschreibt. Der Gothic-Modus wurde verunglimpft, gelobt, der Unrealität vorgeworfen und für das 'Schreckliche Erhabene' gelobt, das er zu erzeugen schien (Burke). Die ursprüngliche \"Gothic Novel,\" Horaces Walpoles 'The Castle of Otranto,' nutzte die Ideen sowohl der 'alten' als auch der 'modernen' Romane, um das proto-Gothic Genre zu schaffen und eine neue Methode der literarischen Ausdrucksweise. Walpole verwendet 'alte' theatralische Elemente und 'neue' Nachahmung der Natur in 'modernen' Romanen, um eine \"Gothic Story\" zu präsentieren (Walpole 4). Die Gothic-Genre nutzt viele Elemente der mittelalterlichen gothischen Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Selbst zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung von 'The Castle of Otranto' wurde das Wort 'gothic' verwendet, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeitperioden zu beschreiben. Es wurde als veraltet odersimpel angesehen im Vergleich zur 'modernen' gesellschaftlichen und literarischen 'Fortschritt'. Die Kombination der mehr theatralischen 'Gothic' und des neuen Formats des Romans (das dem Leser einen persönlicheren Einblick in die Psychologie der Charaktere ermöglicht) ist es, was Gothic dazu ermöglicht, so lange zu bestehen und gleichzeitig veraltet und neu für einen Leser zu erscheinen, der weit zurückliegend zur ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung ist.\n\nEine der prominentesten Ideen der Gothic-Novels ist das Konzept des Rittertums. Das mittelalterliche Ideal des Rittertums, der Prozess der Erziehung eines richtigen Ritters, wird in der ursprünglichen Gothic-Noel 'The Castle of Otranto' sowohl beibehalten als auch transformiert. Rittertum ist für Gothic-Autoren besonders wichtig, weil es das klassische Ideal des Ritters repräsentiert, tapfer, ehrenhaft, fähig – und den vermeintlichen oder wahrgenommenen Mangel dieses Ideals in der Gesellschaft, die die Autoren (besonders Walpole) sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird das 'gothische Vergangene' idealisiert und verromantisiert (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) und wird verwendet, um den gegenwärtigen Zustand verbessern zu wollen. Walpole schrieb 'The Castle of Otranto' inmitten politischer Unruhen und war über die mögliche Zukunft verzweifelt. Er, eingebettet in die Politik und (debatably) ungerechtfertigten Beschuldigungen, begann möglicherweise sogar, wenn auch nicht explizit, zu denken, dass die vermeintliche Moral und innere 'Güte' in den Menschen, die in der gothischen Ära vorhanden waren, auf eine Weise verloren gegangen waren in den Individuen, die die 'gegenwärtige' Gesellschaft bildeten. In seinem Schreiben ist diese Idee klar in mehreren Charakteren zu sehen, einem davon ist die Figur Frederic. Dem Leser wird vor dem Treffen von Frederic klar, dass er viele ritterliche Eigenschaften verkörpert, er wird beschrieben als:\n\nDie Beschreibung umfasst viele traditionelle ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist, zuerst, ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, war geeignet von Tragik, die er verlässt, und ist derzeit angenommen worden, von Ungläubigen getötet worden. Die Figur des 'galanten und höflichen Ritters' ist, natürlich, übertrieben, bringend den baldigen Gothic-Tropus des Exzesses ins Spiel (66).",
            "Die Supply Chain Management ist der Strom von Prozessen, bei denen Waren von der Kundennachfrage bis zur Rohstoffphase, Beschaffung, Produktion und Verteilung von Produkten an den Kunden fließen. Der Begriff Supply Chain Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, geprägt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Supply Chain abläuft, um die Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu befriedigen. Zu einer Supply Chain gehören sechs zentrale Elemente: Produktion, Beschaffung, Lagerhaltung, Lage, Transport und Information. Geschäftsführer nutzen diese sechs wesentlichen Elemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um dies zu erfahren, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator dafür, welche Nachfrage besteht. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert und in welcher Menge sie produziert werden sollen. Nach der Entscheidung der Verwaltung, welche Produkte und in welcher Menge produziert werden sollen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert und in welcher Anlage die beste Produktionsmenge und -qualität gewährleistet wird, unter Berücksichtigung der Kundenbedürfnisse und -zufriedenheit. Nach der Entscheidung über den Produktionsstandort der Produkte konzentriert sich das Management auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Instandhaltung der Ausrüstung. Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Jedes Detail ist von Bedeutung. Wenn jedes Detail nicht entsprechend geplant wird, kann es dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben für jede Einheit des Geschäfts ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess. Es gibt ein entworfenes Layout dafür, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, wenn er eine Lieferung von LKWs entgegennimmt. Ausgearbeitete Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung in Bezug auf Richtung und Erwartungen zu haben.\n\nDas zweite zentrale Element der Supply Chain Management ist die Beschaffung. Beschaffung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden müssen, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung und Partnerschaften zur Zusammenarbeit zu bestimmen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsdivisionen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Divisionen bestehen aus verschiedenen Ausrüstungen, Mitarbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Division am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Die Verwaltung kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, um Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit bedeutet die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten, während gleichzeitig Kosten gesenkt oder niedrige Kosten beibehalten werden.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Der Nachlass von Duke Ellington in der Jazzmusik basiert zum großen Teil auf seiner Langlebigkeit und seiner kreativen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu gestalten. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, als Komponist jedoch überragte er beim Schaffen von reichhaltigen und komplexen Werken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorhoben. Er schuf ein Framework, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, gleichzeitig schrieb er eng getaktete Stücke und Phrasen, die das besondere Spiel der Bandmitglieder herausstellten, um musikalische Ideen zu betonen. Dies ermöglichte es ihm auch, den Klang des Orchesters insgesamt zu betonen und kohärente und originelle Klänge für jedes Stück zu erstellen. Ellingtons Meisterhaftigkeit in der Nutzung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler sowie ihrer Zusammensetzung als wachsendes Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillanten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\nThe Grove Music dictionary erwähnt in der Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation \"Creole Love Call\" als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme als Jazzinstrument während seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Lyrics behindert zu werden. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere ziehen lässt. Dieses langsame, bedächtige Twelve-Bar-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chorusse:\nChorus 1: Ein Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und dann zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nChorus 2: Ein gedämpftes Trompeten-Solo, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere verlängerte Blue Notes betont.\nChorus 3: Ein übergreifendes Klarinettensolo in einem hohen Register, das von einer subtilen syncopierten Klaviereinlage begleitet wird.\nChorus 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call and Response der Blech- und Holzbläser.\nChorus 5: Der klimaktische Chorus des Stücks, bei dem die Holzbläser jetzt das Call and Response in einem hohen Register beginnen, unterstützt von einem syncopierten Stop-Time von Blech- und Rhythmusabteilung.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Choruses, mit einem Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus übernimmt die Stimme den Sound der \"growl\" Technik und soliert als Instrument.\nTag: Ein kurzer Tag mit einer Vocal-Run und einem dissonanten Novität-Einsatz des Trompeten.\nEllingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine Dimension an Klangfarbe zu geben, ist ein Beispiel für einen stilistischen Zug, der seine gesamte Arbeit durchzieht.\nIn \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarbe. Ein Call and Response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox’ Scat-Singen nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley’s Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’ Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu schaffen. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" entwickelt diese Ideen weiter, da Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine festen Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Trompete einzuführen.",
            "She had always felt like something was missing. This desire refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, getting into a teenage life. And it was still there three years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had decided she wanted someone rather than something. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, made awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She often questioned herself with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived her life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and, oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own life, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch... sweet, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by a higher intake of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, and a lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies found an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial showed that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 U.S. states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained their participation over the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounders (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America suffered a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America's largest and most important corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must ask: how did this crisis occur, and how can we prevent it? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans to an already immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserves and transferred this chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 in the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term. To boost his popularity, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately foretold the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the economy's collapse.\n\nMany factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general to over-leverage themselves in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left high and dry. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you spread your literary wings and take flight, astonishing all with your magnetic, nay magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was \"live\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned.\n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" so that you would stay tuned.\n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual amount of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was.\n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story.",
            "Es gibt eine Verbindung zwischen Brüdern; eine unzerbrechliche, unumkehrbare Verbindung. In dieser Verbindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Neid und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere in einer solchen Verbindung, und sie können sich nur in ihrem Bruder sehen. Es ist in den brenzligsten Situationen, dass die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es zum Guten oder Bösen. Wenn diese Gefühle sich zeigen, tragen sie eine große Last mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geborenen Gefühle besteht darin, mit den Konsequenzen umzugehen, die sie nach sich ziehen. Wenn jemand seinem Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und in diesem Menschen sein eigenes Spiegelbild erkennt, sieht er sich nicht so, wie andere ihn sehen, sondern so, wie er wirklich ist. In seinen Taten und den Folgen dieser Taten liegt sein wahres Wesen. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Gefühle, die es begleiten. Auf einer üppigen, lebendig beschriebenen Landschaft machen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine fruchtlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung prallt auf intensive Stolz im Höhepunkt der Geschichte, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten Doodle und ihre Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers ausgedrückt, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seinen Blick auf die Welt um ihn herum übermittelt, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen einwirken.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf ein Schlüsselgefühl zurückführen: Stolz. Von dem Moment, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, zum ersten Mal zusammen ausgingen, bis zu ihrer letzten, entscheidenden Expedition, empfindet der Protagonist Resignation gegenüber Doodle. Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, den er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten lehren konnte, wie \"…den Atem anhalten, rennen, springen oder klettern in Old Woman Swamp…\" Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, der die Rolle eines \"…Partners zum Rennen nach Horsehead Landing…und jemand, um sich mit ihm auf dem obersten Ast der großen Kiefer hinter dem Schuppen zu setzen…\" spielen konnte. Natürlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, da Doodle mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen zur Welt gekommen ist, was es unwahrscheinlich macht, dass er überlebt. Selbst wenn er wahrscheinlich nie an anstrengenden körperlichen Aktivitäten teilnehmen könnte. Was für eine Enttäuschung für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilden Träumen war, dass all diese Träume in einem Moment zerschlagen werden. Er wird sogar gezeigt, dass er einige Wut auf das kleine Kind hat, als er zurückdenkt, dass er begann, über das Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu überlegen. Welches Kind würde solch einen Gedanken haben? Aber sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so einfache Tat gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. In seinem Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.",
            "Das menschliche Gehirn ist ein komplexes, kreatives Informationsverarbeitungssystem. Mit dem Fortschritt der Technologie von primitiv zu modern hat sich auch die Metaphern, die zur Beschreibung des Gehirns verwendet wurden, weiterentwickelt. Zunächst wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Bei der Erforschung des Gehirns sollten die Grenzen und potenziellen Fehlerbehaftetheit dieser Metaphern berücksichtigt werden.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit der Eingabe der Sinnesorgane, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl von unten nach oben als auch von oben nach unten verarbeitet. Zum Beispiel, wenn man ein Bild eines schwarzen Kastens auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachtet, verarbeitet die untere Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Ausrichtung und wo die Objektgrenzen liegen – wo sich die Farbänderungen über einen kurzen Raum schnell ändern – um zu entscheiden, dass man einen Kasten sieht. Die obere Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der unteren Verarbeitung getroffen wurden, um das Erkennen des Kastens zu beschleunigen. Die obere Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, den Gegenstand als schwarzen Kasten und nicht als eine kastenförmige Öffnung im weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\nSobald Informationen in einem bestimmten Maße verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Aufmerkensfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zugänglich gemacht werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet das Gehirn jede Grashalme, wenn man auf seine Schuhe schaut, aber ein gesunder Aufmerkensfilter verhindert, dass man sie einzeln bemerkt. Im Gegensatz dazu könnte man seinen Namen, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird, heraushören. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit immer wieder modifiziert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, müssen sie zunächst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Gedächtnis, darunter sensorisches, Arbeitsgedächtnis und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zunächst wird die Information codiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von sensorischen Reizen sind. Zum Beispiel kann verbaler Input strukturell kodiert werden, was bedeutet, wie das gedruckte Wort aussieht, phonemisch, was bedeutet, wie das Wort klingt, oder semantisch, was bedeutet, was das Wort bedeutet. Sobald die Information gespeichert ist, muss sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch eine elektrische Signalschleife in einer bestimmten Reihe von Neuronen für eine kurze Zeit aufrechterhalten wird. Die Information im Langzeitgedächtnis wird darin vermutet, dass sie in der Struktur bestimmter Proteintypen aufrechterhalten wird.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basierend auf der Art und Weise, wie Menschen Erinnerungen abrufen, andere basierend auf der Informatik und wieder andere basierend auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verbunden sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk \"Stuhl\" mit \"Tisch\" verbunden sein, der wiederum mit \"Holz\" verbunden sein könnte und so weiter.",
            "Aldous Huxley kritisiert die aufkommende Bedrohung sowohl durch Technologie als auch durch das kapitalistische System, durch das es verstärkt wird, indem eine Dystopie in dem Roman Brave New World erschaffen wird. Die Menschen dort schätzen Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an so konditioniert, dass sie das sofortige Glück über alles andere stellen. Die Bürger sind somit nur Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel, das von einem World Controller vorgegeben wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes unter dem Blickwinkel des Marxismus zeigt sich die Skepsis des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung solcher Systeme. Begriffe, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, aus dem Marxismus verstärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Mängeln der aufkommenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Marxistische These der falschen Bewusstseinssatire kritisiert. Dies bedeutet, dass die gewöhnlichen Bürger die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen nicht kennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihren eigenen Vorteilen interessiert sind. Dies wird durch die ideologische Kontrolle der Arbeiterklasse und der einfachen Arbeiter verursacht, was im Brave New World durch die Konditionierung der Bevölkerung deutlich wird. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keine echte eigene Willenskraft; durch Hypnopädie wird der Konsum, das Ausgeben und das Genießen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, ist hier offensichtlich. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst, sondern kaufen förmlich eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (also Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen sind geboren mit dem Wissen darüber, tun aber nichts; wenige Alphas oder Betas, wie z.B. Bernard, tun mehr als nur ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen zwischen den sozialen Schichten, wie weiter unten diskutiert, deutliche Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung durch den Kapitalismus.\n\nIn Brave New World gibt es keine Beziehungen zwischen disparaten Individuen. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden – auch bei den Hauptcharakteren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley damit sagen, dass die Aufwärtsentwicklung von Technologie und Kapitalismus dem Menschen seine Freiheit und seinen Ausdruck nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme einer einzigen Emotion; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, deutliche dargestellt durch die Männerremarks über Frauen, die hauptsächlich auf ihrer körperlichen Attraktivität basieren, und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Erfahrungen. Zudem zeigt die Komplizenhaftigkeit der jeweiligen sozialen Schicht in ihrer Stellung in der Hierarchie die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsamkeit gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den Marxistischen Gedanken über die Arbeiterklasse, die falsch in ihrer eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere versichert werden, solange sie weiter konsumieren, gehorchen und in der Reihe mit den anderen bleiben.",
            "Ich bin nun seit etwa zwei und ein halb Jahren Student an der Universität Park, oder seit vier und ein halb Semestern. Für viele, einschließlich mir, ist es ein Problem, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls Wohnheim untergebracht; fast der östlichste Punkt des Campus, außer dem Stadion und dem Bryce Jordan Center. Von meinem Zuhause in Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen an weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard Gebäude, nicht weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt, konnte es bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. Ein ehemaliger Student, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, рассказал mir, dass die East Halls Wohnheime nicht lange her nicht vom Rest der Schule durch große ungenutzte Grundstücke getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern, großen neuen Gebäuden einschließlich des neuen Käsereis und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstungsgebäude und von Wohnungen umgeben. Während unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss auf die Bedürfnisse von Radfahrern zugeschnitten sein.\n\nIch habe mit einem Freund gesprochen, der kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder angefangen hat, Fahrrad zu fahren. Er sagte, er habe sich gefragt, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrräder sind großartig,\" sagte er, \"es war eine Weile nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die einzige Möglichkeit, sich fortzubewegen.\" Neben der guten Wirkung auf den Körper ist Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Möglichkeit zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt abseits des Campus; fast so weit entfernt vom Campuszentrum wie einige Wohnheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Vorlesungen im Thomas Gebäude, das gut 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit einem Fahrrad kann ich diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich ordentlich in die Pedale trete. Das Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der schnellste Weg zu Thomas Building von meinem Haus aus ist und sie nicht immer ein einfacher Weg für Radfahrer ist. Es gibt auch etwas zu sagen für das Gehen, aber persönlich habe ich keine Zeit, zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre Gehen die einzige zuverlässige Möglichkeit, zu meinen Vorlesungen zu gelangen. Gehen zu Thomas jeden Tag würde mir zusätzliche 30-40 Minuten meines Tages rauben. Das ist mehr als zwei und ein halb Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kommen alle anderen Zeit, die ich für Gehen zu und von anderen Vorlesungen, Terminen und so weiter ausgeben müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich entbehren kann."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In pursuing a career in social work, I intend to follow a path in the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support for troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical behavior, commitment to improving relationships between others and to continually improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others but was unsure of the career path I wanted to take. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals fleeing from their problems through denial and some using coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Due to the situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent's residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents' house. There, I privately expressed my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was nothing the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and made excuses for their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in involving external sources to resolve \"simple\" disputes. After this experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother value important in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and mourn those who have been lost. The concept of the \"individual\" held by society is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like \"everyone else\"? I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to conform to others. Throughout my years in high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: by coloring my hair unnaturally, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "The following paper examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on inherited genetic information as well as medical aspects of health. The sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each selected study to better relate to and explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then criticized to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are dyssomnias or parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of substances. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is a difficulty in achieving or maintaining adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons that are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that animal models of mice can be generalized to human studies. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could alter the ability to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and everyday events that involve monotonous tasks and focus.",
            "Dieser Artikel deckt drei Bereiche des Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) ab. Zunächst wird eine kurze Definition der Erkrankung gegeben. Anschließend wird die Diagnose erklärt, einschließlich der häufigen Merkmale oder \"roten Fahnen\". Abschließend werden Wege beschrieben, wie ein Lehrer in einer inklusiven Klassensituation einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nCAPD, auch Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) genannt, bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditive Informationen verarbeitet. Enger definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung auditativer Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und zu elektrischen auditiven Potentialen führt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Erkrankung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem, also das Gehirn, normal gesprochene Dinge nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normal, sind also nicht als \"hörbehindert\" einzustufen; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der die gehörten Dinge analysiert und erkennt, nicht wie üblich.\n\nDie frühesten Erwähnungen der Erkrankung, die später als CAPD bekannt wurde, stammen aus den 1950er Jahren und wurden als \"auditory imperception\" bezeichnet (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine italienische Forschungsgruppe aus Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura die dichotische Testung und ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS ein, das der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz im Jahr 1977 förderte die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD.\n\nCAPD zeigt sich in verschiedenen Formen: Betroffene können Schwierigkeiten haben, Geräusche räumlich einzuordnen oder zu hören; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, zwei oder mehr \"akustische Ereignisse\" (Geräuschereignisse) zu unterscheiden; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, Muster in Geräuschen zu erkennen; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, Sprachänderungen zu erkennen (wie z.B. das Erkennen von Ironie durch Änderung der Stimme); ein Geräusch kann durch ein folgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; sie könnten Schwierigkeiten haben, auditive Hinweise zu interpretieren und darauf zu reagieren; und sie könnten Schwierigkeiten haben, die Reihenfolge der auditiven Informationen zu bestimmen (Ferre).\n\nZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient systematisch auf sein Hörverhalten und/oder seine Leistung bei Tests der auditiven Funktion überprüft werden. Dies kann von Audiologen, Logopäden, Psychologen und anderen durchgeführt werden, die eine Vielzahl von Maßnahmen verwenden, um auditive Fähigkeiten zu bewerten. Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung auditiver Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktionen auf bestimmte Reize, gehören. Es gibt derzeit kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, das mit hoher Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit konsistent verwendet wird, und die Ursache der Erkrankung ist unbekannt. Viele verwendete Tests stellen dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitig vorliegende auditive Reize vor und fragen nach der Unterscheidung bestimmter Elemente wie einer Serie von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittene Tests umfassen die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to suggest that while disguise can indeed be useful for prolonged deception, in the end one must reject this newly assumed guise or risk losing oneself entirely. The problem with ending a deception, however, is that it may leave one feeling isolated. Therefore, in the end, one must choose between self-preservation and preserving relationships with those around them. While some may respond neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others will not take it lightly and may be offended by the whole charade.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender reversal is particularly problematic as it raises many secondary issues, with the most significant question being: Why? Why does one feel the need to shirk their own identity and take on a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is obviously a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Not only that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception can facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages hint that these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia secretly harbor feelings for women? One could argue that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those of his time who judge others solely based on their appearance.\n\nThis is evident in how easily Olivia switches her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "Compared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert.

            "The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters, most if not all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, which was then followed by sub-sub-genres, and the chain continues until today.\n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70’s that led to people getting crazier, leading to them to make crazy, other-worldly records, using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down, supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they put that song on The White Album.",
            "Before one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.",
            "Viele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer grundlegenden Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seinem Gedicht „Ode on a Grecian Urn“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit ist Schönheit – das ist alles, was auf Erden bekannt ist und alles, was man wissen muss.“ Vieles, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Dennoch scheinen wir Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, wie Keats andeutet, ohne sie auf diese Weise zu lernen. Beide, Ethik und Ästhetik, sind Versuche, zu beschreiben, nicht zu vorschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind in der Regel Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt ein Regelwerk zum Beurteilen oder Schaffen guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens zu sein.\nRelevanter noch: Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann nie vollständig das Wesentliche von Gutem oder Schönem erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert des Mona Lisa von da Vinci, zum Beispiel, könnte sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturelle Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Vielmehr, wenn man nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literaturwerk gefragt wird, ist es üblich, eine Phrase wie „Es gibt einfach etwas daran“ zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nicht vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Weise, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann … man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Erklärung unzureichend wäre.“ Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, es bleibt immer etwas Transzendentale. Ich glaube, dass Ethik ebenfalls diese Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. / . Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses ‚etwas‘, dieses Je ne sais quoi, ist, das die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir sie beide am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, um einen kantischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf einer Ebene, die erlebt werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie Robert McKean sagt: „Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was sie einzigartig macht, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es könnte sein, dass moralische Standards anderen Künsten wie der Musik nicht angemessen sind, aber sie scheinen so relevant für die Literatur wie für das Leben selbst zu sein. Leben notwendigerweise Werte zu integrieren …. Literatur ist uns wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir suchen.“",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful force, a unified country with a unique culture that can be felt from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is also evident in Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinct culture, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, has originated from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that it came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously called Germans before crossing the Rhine and battling the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars to distinguish between those he conquered (the Gauls) and those he didn't. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it comes from the Gaulish word for a neighbor, or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that \"I regard them [the Germans] as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet, at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and occasionally lead land campaigns but mostly returned to their sprawling empire. As Germanic tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army.

            "I looked down, mind blankly comprehending the scene in front of me. Unemotionally, silently, I studied the object with practiced awareness, refusing to relate it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flickered into my mind and dissipated almost faster than they appeared. My consciousness worked so smoothly that it seemed I had no thoughts of my own, just a liquid experience of what I was observing.\nOnce, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw since I was six and this book teaches everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wants to study. Thus, a complex picture like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room is transformed into a simple, easily grasped image.\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was so overwhelmed, so awestruck that I could only stand and gaze in wonder. Picasso went through his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters used a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of considering my perspective artistic, before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\nMy fingertips touched my chosen artistic tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will taking shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Matter flakes broke away from the whole and dissipated into nothingness. Muscles tightened, twitching and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand hit the toilet handle again. The offensive brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom.\nMop loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for the bath cleanup crew at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments, then my hand reached for the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping it tightly until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing tall, then bending at the waist, my hand slipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenager sterben hinter dem Steuer. Verschiedene Faktoren kommen zusammen und ergeben eine tödliche Statistik für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer. Das Nationale Institut für Gesundheit erklärt, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Teenagerhirn einfach nicht für die Gefahren des Fahrens bereit ist. Einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt auch am Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate an Überschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Straßenabfahrten.\n\nTeens haben es auch weit schwerer, wenn sie mit ihren Gleichaltrigen unterwegs sind – etwas, das jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center hat eine Studie durchgeführt, die die folgende Korrelation gezeigt hat: die Altersgruppe der Mitfahrer und die Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\n\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit der Teenagerfahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie eine provisorische Lizenz einführen, die die Fahrzeiten und die Mitfahrt von anderen Minderjährigen beschränkt.\n\nDiese provisorischen Fahrerlaubnisse sind jedoch, wie ich denke, nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem besteht darin, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe nach allen statistischen Indikatoren die Risiken und Verantwortungen nicht ausreichend bewältigen können. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 Jahre zu jung für eine reguläre Fahrerlaubnis ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungsergebnisse veröffentlicht hat, die einen Wunsch unter den 19-20-Jährigen zeigen, Risiken für den reinen Kick aus dem Gefühl des Risikos einzugehen. Es macht daher Sinn, das Fahren mindestens bis zu dem Zeitpunkt zu verzögern, an dem der Wunsch nach Risikoerfahrungen nachgelassen hat. Wenn wir weiterhin Fahrerlaubnisse an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Todesopferzahl wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich in erschreckenden Ausmaßen steigen. Bis 2010 werden die Kinder der Baby-Boomer Generation das Fahrtziel erreichen, und Millionen neuer Teenagerfahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\n\nGesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre angemessen einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulkurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Motorfahrzeug führen. Eine vorläufige Erlaubnis könnte weiterhin vor der Ausstellung einer vollständigen Fahrerlaubnis ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden wäre weiterhin erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Grundlage der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Bundesstaaten gefordert wird (in Kalifornien beträgt diese Anzahl derzeit 6 Stunden praktische Fahrzeit und 50 Stunden mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken der Teenagerfahrer auf einer Vielzahl von Bundesstaaten basieren, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema eine vernünftige – und ich glaube, auch wirksame – Maßnahme, um Teenager in ganz Amerika zu schützen.\n\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.",
            "In examining the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outliers present in a few of the later films. For the most part, trick films at the turn of the century were stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, featured no camera movement, used long and medium shots, and adhered to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are a few films from the early 20th century that dared to break these guidelines by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable common aspects of trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This was borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups do not occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be composed of several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Take a close look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor von Caroline war ein früher und eifriger Befürworter des Republikanismus. Trotz seiner Haupttätigkeit als Landwirt, die gemeinsam mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere dazu führte, dass er als ein Mann bekannt wurde, der sich leidenschaftlich für persönliche Freiheit und Regierung einsetzte. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Ansichten über die Regierung. Es war sein Bestreben, das, was er für die vorzüglichste aller Berufe hielt, zu bewahren und zu fördern, das seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Rechtssystem färbte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu entwickeln, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was die Schaffung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängen – das bedeutet, dass, wenn einem verweigert wird, dann alle scheitern und der Wert der verbleibenden erschüttert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige als „Naturzustand“ bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen, die über körperliche Stärke und böse Intelligenz verfügten, profitierten, aber in einer Zivilisation sollte dies nicht der Fall sein.\n\nUm dieses ideale Gesellschaftssystem zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung entwickelt werden müsse, die die intrinsische Gutheit und Bösartigkeit des Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr strikt in seinen Ansichten zu einer dualistischen Moral. Er sagte: „Da die Regierung durch den Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein“ (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und Kapitalismus abschrecken. Er glaubte, dass eine in guten Prinzipien gegründete Regierung fair funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Administration, die zwangsläufig von Habgier und Eigennutz geprägt wäre. Eigennutz, so glaubte er, ist der Antrieb des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber er wird nur böse, wenn er sich von der Schaffung einer auf dem öffentlichen Wohl basierenden Gesellschaft zu Subgesellschaften entwickelt, die auf Kosten anderer leben. Eine gute Regierung sei notwendig, um die natürliche Bosheit des Menschen in Schach zu halten, und selbst dann müsse sie unter strenger Beobachtung stehen, um das Hinzufügen schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, plädierte für eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung, der keine weiteren Rechte oder Befugnisse als die in der Verfassung ausdrücklich genannten zugestanden würden. Er wusste, dass eine ausgedehnte Bundesregierung teuer und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch wäre. Allerdings glaubte er, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich sei und ohne den Bezug auf den Willen der Schriftsteller leicht korrupt werden könne. Noch mehr, er betrachtete die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als das wahre Grundgesetz der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land klarer als eine Gruppe von souveränen Staaten als eine Nation beschreibt.",
            "Bezugnehmend auf Figur 17 gab es im dritten Monat des Projekts einen dramatischen Rückgang der Einreichungen der Pendlerprotokolle. Das war ein wenig enttäuschend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters an einer Campus im New England zeigt sich claramente ein Rückgang an Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß zur Arbeit kommen, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, in dem alle sehr beschäftigt sind, um Hausaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls könnte für viele einfach aus dem Blickfeld geraten sein. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember den Beginn der hektischen Feiertagssaison und die damit verbundene monatelange Pause für Studenten und Mitarbeiter, in der viele nicht einmal zur Campus kommen müssen. Der Unterricht beginnt dann wieder für das Frühlings Trimester Ende Januar, was möglicherweise auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl der Protokolle für diesen Monat ist. Jedoch erklärt das die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar nicht. Man könnte vermuten, dass ein Projekt dieser Art zunächst einen Anstieg an Energie und Aufregung erlebt, der dann möglicherweise natürlisch abnimmt. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die „Carpool Challenge Week“ ins Leben gerufen, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Projekt wieder zu beflügeln, was zu einer Erhöhung der Protokolleinreichungen für diesen Monat führte. Somit war eines der Herausforderungen, die wir bei diesem Projekt (oder einem alternativen Pendelprojekt) erlebten, wie man das Projektmomentum trotz eines natürlichen Rückgangs an Engagement aufrechterhält, aber auch spezifisch die Problematik von Feiertagen und Semesterpausen im Hochschulbereich. Eine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder ein alternatives Pendelprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens schätzen. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es entscheidend, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Pendelmodalitäten zu schaffen. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagesalons, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Ketten ausgegeben. Es wäre interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie größere Preise die Teilnahme beeinflusst hätten – wie zum Beispiel das Verteilen eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybride- oder Elektroautos. Das hätte auch helfen können, dem Rückgang an Engagement entgegenzuwirken, den das Projekt erlebte. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Projekts nicht. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts erhöht worden wären, das könnte geholfen haben. Die Geschenkgutscheine schienen am Anfang des Projekts völlig ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung einiger Fahrräder und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybride- oder Elektroautos angekündigt hätten, könnte man nur denken, dass das Teilnehmen und das Engagement gestiegen wäre, anstatt abzunehmen.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction.  Although these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another advantage of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\n\tTo evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, so we have decided to include only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tTo gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio were made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart, it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\n\tTo evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors.\n\nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”. The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem.\n\nGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.",
            "Unter dem kalifornischen Recht könnte ein Kunde, der nach einem Sturz auf einem Obstmusspfad in einem Supermarkt verletzt wurde, Schadensersatz in Höhe von Strafschadensersatz erhalten, wenn gezeigt wird, dass der Ladengehilfe absichtlich gehandelt hat, da er zweimal über die Pfütze informiert wurde und sie nicht in 30 Minuten entfernt wurde, obwohl er Abendessen aß?\nEin Richter wird Jennifer Palmers Strafschadensersatzanspruch wahrscheinlich nicht summarisch abweisen. Um einen Anspruch auf die Verurteilung von Strafschadensersatz zu erheben, muss der Kläger Beweise vorlegen, dass die Handlungen des Beklagten absichtlich und bewusst mit dem Ziel begangen wurden, wahrscheinlich auftretenden Schaden zu verursachen, sowie dass die Handlung verabscheuungswürdig war. Palmer kann argumentieren, dass Martin die wahrscheinlich gefährdende Situation der Pfütze kennen musste, da sich in den Monaten vor ihrem Unfall mehrere Kund:innen von D&D durch Ausrutschen verletzt hatten; und trotz dieses Wissens die Pfütze nicht entfernt wurde. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verabscheuungswürdig waren, ist weniger überzeugend, ist aber dennoch gerechtfertigt gegeben die Fakten, dass sechs Ausrutschunghandlungen im Jahr 2009 aufgetreten sind und Martin dennoch keine angemessenen Maßnahmen ergriffen hat, um die Sicherheit seines Ladens zu gewährleisten.\n\nAm 13. Oktober 2009 um 17:00 Uhr informierte ein Mitarbeiter von D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, seinen Vorgesetzten, Paul Martin, über eine Obstmusspfütze in einem Gang.

Haddigan, ebenfalls über die Pfütze, und Martin reagierte ähnlich. Um 17:30 Uhr am Dreizehnten rutschte die Klägerin, Jennifer Palmer, auf der Pfütze aus und erlitt eine schwere Rückenverletzung. Vor Palmers Unfall waren im Jahr 2009 fünf verschiedene Ausrutschhandlungen in D&D gemeldet worden. Palmer verklagt D&D nun auf Entschädigung und Strafschadensersatz wegen ihrer Verletzung und wir untersuchen, ob eine teilweise Zusammenfassung für den Strafschadensersatzanspruch eingereicht werden soll.\n\nIn Kalifornien kann ein Kläger für eine Pflichtverletzung, die nicht aus einem Vertrag hervorgeht, Strafschadensersatz erhalten, wenn der Beklagte \"Drangsalierung, Betrug oder Bosheit\" begangen hat.

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally observed mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nThere are also some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of 'witness' or of how people 'on their own' converted to Islam. But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third-party perspective. That is, in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc. I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these different techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby\". Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In his novel \"The Great Gatsby\" F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and red/pink, and then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an important object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit nicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the beginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring many common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community-supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while improving habitat, thus permitting recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and other programs for generating income or educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area due to the lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often has greater costs than conventional farming. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Therefore, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "**\n\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective.",
            "Der Narr hat in seinem Herzen gesagt: „Es gibt keinen Gott.“ Dieser Gedanke erscheint erstmals im Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und ist der Beginn von St. Anselms Argumentation zur Existenz Gottes. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch der andere Autor, Thomas Aquinas, zu teilen, den wir diskutieren werden. Da beide ihre Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts vorbringen und unsere Aufgabe darin besteht, festzustellen, welche der beiden besser ist, müssen wir aus praktischen Gründen voraussetzen, dass sie beide in ihrer Überzeugung, dass es den Gott der Bibel gibt, richtig liegen. Ein Gott-Typus, der sich von dem unterscheidet, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht gestatten, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie beide im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung einer bestimmten Gottesvorstellung stehen. Es sei jedoch gesagt, dass ich glaube, dass beide Autoren zwar berechtigte Punkte bringen, aber keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\nUm dies zu veranschaulichen, untersuchen wir nun das Grundargument von St. Anselm. Anselms Passage beschreibt einen Weg der Erkenntnis durch den Glauben, indem man in sich selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass Gott in unserem Verstand existiert, sodass wir seine Nicht-Existenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während seine Argumentation in seiner Terminologie oft ermüdend und unklar ist, besteht die Hauptaussage darin, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht hinausgehen müssen über die Grenzen unserer Seele, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens in der Wahrheit liegt, die wir ohnehin innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes kennen. Außerevidenz sei angeblich nicht notwendig. Dieses Konzept, etwas zu akzeptieren, für das es keinen unbestrittenen empirischen Beleg gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\nDies ist ein sehr anderer Standpunkt als der von St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas meint, dass sich die Existenz Gottes durch reinen Verstand und empirische Beweise beweisen lässt, ohne dass Glaube notwendig ist. Eine solche Vorstellung wäre vorteilhaft für das Evangelisieren, ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Christentums, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von deren Bereitschaft, etwas Unbewiesenes zu akzeptieren, ermöglichen würde. Sie könnten stattdessen durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes beweisen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grade des Vorzugs und Harmonie. In jedem dieser Argumente zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man dir sagt, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du den Rest des Puzzles zusammenstellst, so diktiert die Logik, dass du die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Puzzleteils ohne es zu sehen kennen kannst.",
            "**\n\nSometime zwischen dem 5. und 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der später als Buddha bekannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens verließ er die Welt und erlangte Erleuchtung, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus – der am traditionellsten Orthodoxe davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddha-Zeiten. Dies zeigt sich überall, etwa in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasserritzfeier begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen daran teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nichts dergleichen gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von superfiziellen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinschaft, sowohl aus klösterlicher als auch aus layperspektiver Sicht, musste ihre doctrinalen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies kann auf innere und äußere, feindliche und wohlwollende Einflüsse zurückgeführt werden.\n\nEs gibt einige Begriffe, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Ein innerer Faktor wird als ein Faktor definiert, der von den Anhängern des Buddhismus stammt, unabhängig von ihrem status. Ein äußerer Faktor ist jeder Faktor von Nicht-Buddhisten. Ein feindlicher Faktor ist jeder Faktor, der der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder ihr schaden will – ein Faktor, der aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Ein wohlwollender Faktor ist ein Faktor, der die Buddhistengemeinde nicht schaden oder ihr helfen will, obwohl er dies möglicherweise als Nebenwirkung tut. Diese Begriffe werden im Laufe dieser Diskussion häufig vorkommen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Schutz in den drei Juwelen des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus der Tripitaka – den drei Körben – der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka die disziplinären Regeln, und der Abhidhamma Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Konzepte umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – kein Selbst, Dukkha – das Leiden im Leben, und Anicca – die Vergänglichkeit alles. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Geburt und Tod, beenden, der unaufhörlich geschieht. Mit Sansara werden auch Lobha – Gelüste, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden die Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, Ich werde nicht lügen, Ich werde nicht stehlen, Ich werde mich nicht unzüchtig verhalten und Ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinäre Regeln. Der fundamentale doctrinale Begriff in Buddhism ist der Begriff der vier heiligen Wahrheiten. Erstens Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n**",
            "The United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which were once plagued by a long-lasting rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as major conflicts of interest (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not unique; many nations have enduring rivalries with their neighbors. Nations sharing a border often have conflicting interests that lead to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are no different from many other enduring rivalries between neighboring nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American nations have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues created a divide between the two nations, a problem that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that \"if in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Not unlike the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was part ideological struggle and part competition for vital interests, the ideological struggles between the U.S. and Mexico were based on religious preferences rather than political structures. This distrust stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their former colonial rulers, which was a significant obstacle in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, revolved around territorial issues such as border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from U.S. border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both countries exerted military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and finally ended when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the nineteenth century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suddenly and unexpectedly became disabled by an illness I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply ingrained need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So – even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a little of both – I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, here I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but there is one thing that I know to be true: I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life – big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on their own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again – learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than having each of us individually scrambling out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food – do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms\", the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively static over the last ten years. While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015. The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target. That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done. In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%. The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue. While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural. This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country. Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas. Another issue of access concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\nIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child. There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results. There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period. Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "Vor ein paar Jahren arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, in dem ich Grundschüler in verschiedenen Fächern unterrichtete. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen zu helfen, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englischen und im Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen. Adrian war entweder in der dritten oder vierten Klasse und hatte große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen. Irgendwann fiel mir auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte: Er konnte einige Buchstaben perfekt aussprechen, andere aber überhaupt nicht. Er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war sicher, aber er sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich war beim Babysitten für einige wenige Kinder, während der Rest der Gruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als sie hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr begrenztem Spanisch-Kenntnissen konnten wir kommunizieren. Dann fiel es mir wie ein Schlag auf den Kopf: Adrian konnte gut lesen, aber er kannte die englische Alphabet nicht besonders gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe doch, dass es ihm besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um auf das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, einzugehen. Auch um zu zeigen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann beim Lesen noch große Schwierigkeiten haben. Ich bin sicher, dass jeder mit diesem Problem konfrontiert ist, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Lesetraining in Englisch, insbesondere das Alphabet und die Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Der Dual-Language-System, die Hauptimmersion, private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Maßnahmen allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt in der Kombination all dieser Elemente!\n\nZunächst einmal: Das Dual-Language-System ist eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in Zweisprachenschulen haben sich akademisch besser entwickelt als ihre Altersgenossen.\" Viele haben Angst vor dieser Idee, dass sie eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die meisten Kinder in der Schule davon keinen Nutzen haben. Das ist aber falsch. Wenn wir solche Programme in der Schule als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie erreichen wir das? Möchten wir alle Lehrer bilingual? Nein, das wäre unrealistisch und überfordert. Aber ich denke, es gibt keinen Grund, warum wir nicht spezialisierte Helfer und Tutoren haben könnten, die bilingual sind.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are taught that there is something out there that is greater than we are, that is beyond our comprehension. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to church or search within ourselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and adopt another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, his gaze both searching and remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely from his body. His hair was sparser than I remembered. He stared out into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months beyond the doctors’ predictions. What the value was in him merely suffering longer, I could not comprehend. What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "Die traditionelle \"Gothic Novel\" ist im Kern und im Namen ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neue,'\" wie Ian Watt es in 'The Rise of the Gothic Novel' beschreibt. Der Gothic-Modus wurde verunglimpft, gelobt, der Unrealität vorgeworfen und für das 'Schreckliche Erhabene' gelobt, das er zu erzeugen schien (Burke). Die ursprüngliche \"Gothic Novel,\" Horaces Walpoles 'The Castle of Otranto,' nutzte die Ideen sowohl der 'alten' als auch der 'modernen' Romane, um das proto-Gothic Genre zu schaffen und eine neue Methode der literarischen Ausdrucksweise. Walpole verwendet 'alte' theatralische Elemente und 'neue' Nachahmung der Natur in 'modernen' Romanen, um eine \"Gothic Story\" zu präsentieren (Walpole 4). Die Gothic-Genre nutzt viele Elemente der mittelalterlichen gothischen Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Selbst zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung von 'The Castle of Otranto' wurde das Wort 'gothic' verwendet, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeitperioden zu beschreiben. Es wurde als veraltet odersimpel angesehen im Vergleich zur 'modernen' gesellschaftlichen und literarischen 'Fortschritt'. Die Kombination der mehr theatralischen 'Gothic' und des neuen Formats des Romans (das dem Leser einen persönlicheren Einblick in die Psychologie der Charaktere ermöglicht) ist es, was Gothic dazu ermöglicht, so lange zu bestehen und gleichzeitig veraltet und neu für einen Leser zu erscheinen, der weit zurückliegend zur ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung ist.\n\nEine der prominentesten Ideen der Gothic-Novels ist das Konzept des Rittertums. Das mittelalterliche Ideal des Rittertums, der Prozess der Erziehung eines richtigen Ritters, wird in der ursprünglichen Gothic-Noel 'The Castle of Otranto' sowohl beibehalten als auch transformiert. Rittertum ist für Gothic-Autoren besonders wichtig, weil es das klassische Ideal des Ritters repräsentiert, tapfer, ehrenhaft, fähig – und den vermeintlichen oder wahrgenommenen Mangel dieses Ideals in der Gesellschaft, die die Autoren (besonders Walpole) sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird das 'gothische Vergangene' idealisiert und verromantisiert (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) und wird verwendet, um den gegenwärtigen Zustand verbessern zu wollen. Walpole schrieb 'The Castle of Otranto' inmitten politischer Unruhen und war über die mögliche Zukunft verzweifelt. Er, eingebettet in die Politik und (debatably) ungerechtfertigten Beschuldigungen, begann möglicherweise sogar, wenn auch nicht explizit, zu denken, dass die vermeintliche Moral und innere 'Güte' in den Menschen, die in der gothischen Ära vorhanden waren, auf eine Weise verloren gegangen waren in den Individuen, die die 'gegenwärtige' Gesellschaft bildeten. In seinem Schreiben ist diese Idee klar in mehreren Charakteren zu sehen, einem davon ist die Figur Frederic. Dem Leser wird vor dem Treffen von Frederic klar, dass er viele ritterliche Eigenschaften verkörpert, er wird beschrieben als:\n\nDie Beschreibung umfasst viele traditionelle ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist, zuerst, ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, war geeignet von Tragik, die er verlässt, und ist derzeit angenommen worden, von Ungläubigen getötet worden. Die Figur des 'galanten und höflichen Ritters' ist, natürlich, übertrieben, bringend den baldigen Gothic-Tropus des Exzesses ins Spiel (66).",

Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Supply Chain abläuft, um die Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu befriedigen. Zu einer Supply Chain gehören sechs zentrale Elemente: Produktion, Beschaffung, Lagerhaltung, Lage, Transport und Information. Geschäftsführer nutzen diese sechs wesentlichen Elemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um dies zu erfahren, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator dafür, welche Nachfrage besteht. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert und in welcher Menge sie produziert werden sollen. Nach der Entscheidung der Verwaltung, welche Produkte und in welcher Menge produziert werden sollen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert und in welcher Anlage die beste Produktionsmenge und -qualität gewährleistet wird, unter Berücksichtigung der Kundenbedürfnisse und -zufriedenheit. Nach der Entscheidung über den Produktionsstandort der Produkte konzentriert sich das Management auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Instandhaltung der Ausrüstung. Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Jedes Detail ist von Bedeutung. Wenn jedes Detail nicht entsprechend geplant wird, kann es dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben für jede Einheit des Geschäfts ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess. Es gibt ein entworfenes Layout dafür, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, wenn er eine Lieferung von LKWs entgegennimmt. Ausgearbeitete Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung in Bezug auf Richtung und Erwartungen zu haben.\n\nDas zweite zentrale Element der Supply Chain Management ist die Beschaffung. Beschaffung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden müssen, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung und Partnerschaften zur Zusammenarbeit zu bestimmen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsdivisionen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Divisionen bestehen aus verschiedenen Ausrüstungen, Mitarbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Division am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Die Verwaltung kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, um Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit bedeutet die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten, während gleichzeitig Kosten gesenkt oder niedrige Kosten beibehalten werden.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Der Nachlass von Duke Ellington in der Jazzmusik basiert zum großen Teil auf seiner Langlebigkeit und seiner kreativen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu gestalten. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, als Komponist jedoch überragte er beim Schaffen von reichhaltigen und komplexen Werken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorhoben. Er schuf ein Framework, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, gleichzeitig schrieb er eng getaktete Stücke und Phrasen, die das besondere Spiel der Bandmitglieder herausstellten, um musikalische Ideen zu betonen. Dies ermöglichte es ihm auch, den Klang des Orchesters insgesamt zu betonen und kohärente und originelle Klänge für jedes Stück zu erstellen. Ellingtons Meisterhaftigkeit in der Nutzung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler sowie ihrer Zusammensetzung als wachsendes Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillanten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\nThe Grove Music dictionary erwähnt in der Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation \"Creole Love Call\" als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme als Jazzinstrument während seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Lyrics behindert zu werden. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere ziehen lässt. Dieses langsame, bedächtige Twelve-Bar-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chorusse:\nChorus 1: Ein Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und dann zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nChorus 2: Ein gedämpftes Trompeten-Solo, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere verlängerte Blue Notes betont.\nChorus 3: Ein übergreifendes Klarinettensolo in einem hohen Register, das von einer subtilen syncopierten Klaviereinlage begleitet wird.\nChorus 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call and Response der Blech- und Holzbläser.\nChorus 5: Der klimaktische Chorus des Stücks, bei dem die Holzbläser jetzt das Call and Response in einem hohen Register beginnen, unterstützt von einem syncopierten Stop-Time von Blech- und Rhythmusabteilung.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Choruses, mit einem Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus übernimmt die Stimme den Sound der \"growl\" Technik und soliert als Instrument.\nTag: Ein kurzer Tag mit einer Vocal-Run und einem dissonanten Novität-Einsatz des Trompeten.\nEllingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine Dimension an Klangfarbe zu geben, ist ein Beispiel für einen stilistischen Zug, der seine gesamte Arbeit durchzieht.\nIn \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarbe. Ein Call and Response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox’ Scat-Singen nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley’s Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’ Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu schaffen. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" entwickelt diese Ideen weiter, da Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine festen Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Trompete einzuführen.",
            "She had always felt like something was missing. This desire refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, getting into a teenage life. And it was still there three years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had decided she wanted someone rather than something. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, made awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She often questioned herself with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived her life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and, oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own life, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch... sweet, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by a higher intake of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, and a lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies found an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial showed that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 U.S. states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained their participation over the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounders (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America suffered a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America's largest and most important corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must ask: how did this crisis occur, and how can we prevent it? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans to an already immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserves and transferred this chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 in the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term. To boost his popularity, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately foretold the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the economy's collapse.\n\nMany factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general to over-leverage themselves in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left high and dry. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you spread your literary wings and take flight, astonishing all with your magnetic, nay magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was \"live\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned.\n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" so that you would stay tuned.\n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual amount of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was.\n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story.",
            "Es gibt eine Verbindung zwischen Brüdern; eine unzerbrechliche, unumkehrbare Verbindung. In dieser Verbindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Neid und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere in einer solchen Verbindung, und sie können sich nur in ihrem Bruder sehen. Es ist in den brenzligsten Situationen, dass die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es zum Guten oder Bösen. Wenn diese Gefühle sich zeigen, tragen sie eine große Last mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geborenen Gefühle besteht darin, mit den Konsequenzen umzugehen, die sie nach sich ziehen. Wenn jemand seinem Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und in diesem Menschen sein eigenes Spiegelbild erkennt, sieht er sich nicht so, wie andere ihn sehen, sondern so, wie er wirklich ist. In seinen Taten und den Folgen dieser Taten liegt sein wahres Wesen. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Gefühle, die es begleiten. Auf einer üppigen, lebendig beschriebenen Landschaft machen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine fruchtlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung prallt auf intensive Stolz im Höhepunkt der Geschichte, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten Doodle und ihre Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers ausgedrückt, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seinen Blick auf die Welt um ihn herum übermittelt, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen einwirken.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf ein Schlüsselgefühl zurückführen: Stolz. Von dem Moment, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, zum ersten Mal zusammen ausgingen, bis zu ihrer letzten, entscheidenden Expedition, empfindet der Protagonist Resignation gegenüber Doodle. Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, den er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten lehren konnte, wie \"…den Atem anhalten, rennen, springen oder klettern in Old Woman Swamp…\" Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, der die Rolle eines \"…Partners zum Rennen nach Horsehead Landing…und jemand, um sich mit ihm auf dem obersten Ast der großen Kiefer hinter dem Schuppen zu setzen…\" spielen konnte. Natürlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, da Doodle mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen zur Welt gekommen ist, was es unwahrscheinlich macht, dass er überlebt. Selbst wenn er wahrscheinlich nie an anstrengenden körperlichen Aktivitäten teilnehmen könnte. Was für eine Enttäuschung für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilden Träumen war, dass all diese Träume in einem Moment zerschlagen werden. Er wird sogar gezeigt, dass er einige Wut auf das kleine Kind hat, als er zurückdenkt, dass er begann, über das Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu überlegen. Welches Kind würde solch einen Gedanken haben? Aber sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so einfache Tat gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. In seinem Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.",
            "Das menschliche Gehirn ist ein komplexes, kreatives Informationsverarbeitungssystem. Mit dem Fortschritt der Technologie von primitiv zu modern hat sich auch die Metaphern, die zur Beschreibung des Gehirns verwendet wurden, weiterentwickelt. Zunächst wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Bei der Erforschung des Gehirns sollten die Grenzen und potenziellen Fehlerbehaftetheit dieser Metaphern berücksichtigt werden.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit der Eingabe der Sinnesorgane, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl von unten nach oben als auch von oben nach unten verarbeitet. Zum Beispiel, wenn man ein Bild eines schwarzen Kastens auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachtet, verarbeitet die untere Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Ausrichtung und wo die Objektgrenzen liegen – wo sich die Farbänderungen über einen kurzen Raum schnell ändern – um zu entscheiden, dass man einen Kasten sieht. Die obere Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der unteren Verarbeitung getroffen wurden, um das Erkennen des Kastens zu beschleunigen. Die obere Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, den Gegenstand als schwarzen Kasten und nicht als eine kastenförmige Öffnung im weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\nSobald Informationen in einem bestimmten Maße verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Aufmerkensfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zugänglich gemacht werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet das Gehirn jede Grashalme, wenn man auf seine Schuhe schaut, aber ein gesunder Aufmerkensfilter verhindert, dass man sie einzeln bemerkt. Im Gegensatz dazu könnte man seinen Namen, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird, heraushören. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit immer wieder modifiziert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, müssen sie zunächst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Gedächtnis, darunter sensorisches, Arbeitsgedächtnis und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zunächst wird die Information codiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von sensorischen Reizen sind. Zum Beispiel kann verbaler Input strukturell kodiert werden, was bedeutet, wie das gedruckte Wort aussieht, phonemisch, was bedeutet, wie das Wort klingt, oder semantisch, was bedeutet, was das Wort bedeutet. Sobald die Information gespeichert ist, muss sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch eine elektrische Signalschleife in einer bestimmten Reihe von Neuronen für eine kurze Zeit aufrechterhalten wird. Die Information im Langzeitgedächtnis wird darin vermutet, dass sie in der Struktur bestimmter Proteintypen aufrechterhalten wird.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basierend auf der Art und Weise, wie Menschen Erinnerungen abrufen, andere basierend auf der Informatik und wieder andere basierend auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verbunden sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk \"Stuhl\" mit \"Tisch\" verbunden sein, der wiederum mit \"Holz\" verbunden sein könnte und so weiter.",
            "Aldous Huxley kritisiert die aufkommende Bedrohung sowohl durch Technologie als auch durch das kapitalistische System, durch das es verstärkt wird, indem eine Dystopie in dem Roman Brave New World erschaffen wird. Die Menschen dort schätzen Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an so konditioniert, dass sie das sofortige Glück über alles andere stellen. Die Bürger sind somit nur Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel, das von einem World Controller vorgegeben wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes unter dem Blickwinkel des Marxismus zeigt sich die Skepsis des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung solcher Systeme. Begriffe, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, aus dem Marxismus verstärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Mängeln der aufkommenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Marxistische These der falschen Bewusstseinssatire kritisiert. Dies bedeutet, dass die gewöhnlichen Bürger die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen nicht kennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihren eigenen Vorteilen interessiert sind. Dies wird durch die ideologische Kontrolle der Arbeiterklasse und der einfachen Arbeiter verursacht, was im Brave New World durch die Konditionierung der Bevölkerung deutlich wird. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keine echte eigene Willenskraft; durch Hypnopädie wird der Konsum, das Ausgeben und das Genießen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, ist hier offensichtlich. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst, sondern kaufen förmlich eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (also Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen sind geboren mit dem Wissen darüber, tun aber nichts; wenige Alphas oder Betas, wie z.B. Bernard, tun mehr als nur ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen zwischen den sozialen Schichten, wie weiter unten diskutiert, deutliche Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung durch den Kapitalismus.\n\nIn Brave New World gibt es keine Beziehungen zwischen disparaten Individuen. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden – auch bei den Hauptcharakteren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley damit sagen, dass die Aufwärtsentwicklung von Technologie und Kapitalismus dem Menschen seine Freiheit und seinen Ausdruck nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme einer einzigen Emotion; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, deutliche dargestellt durch die Männerremarks über Frauen, die hauptsächlich auf ihrer körperlichen Attraktivität basieren, und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Erfahrungen. Zudem zeigt die Komplizenhaftigkeit der jeweiligen sozialen Schicht in ihrer Stellung in der Hierarchie die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsamkeit gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den Marxistischen Gedanken über die Arbeiterklasse, die falsch in ihrer eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere versichert werden, solange sie weiter konsumieren, gehorchen und in der Reihe mit den anderen bleiben.",
            "Ich bin nun seit etwa zwei und ein halb Jahren Student an der Universität Park, oder seit vier und ein halb Semestern. Für viele, einschließlich mir, ist es ein Problem, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls Wohnheim untergebracht; fast der östlichste Punkt des Campus, außer dem Stadion und dem Bryce Jordan Center. Von meinem Zuhause in Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen an weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard Gebäude, nicht weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt, konnte es bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. Ein ehemaliger Student, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, рассказал mir, dass die East Halls Wohnheime nicht lange her nicht vom Rest der Schule durch große ungenutzte Grundstücke getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern, großen neuen Gebäuden einschließlich des neuen Käsereis und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstungsgebäude und von Wohnungen umgeben. Während unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss auf die Bedürfnisse von Radfahrern zugeschnitten sein.\n\nIch habe mit einem Freund gesprochen, der kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder angefangen hat, Fahrrad zu fahren. Er sagte, er habe sich gefragt, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrräder sind großartig,\" sagte er, \"es war eine Weile nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die einzige Möglichkeit, sich fortzubewegen.\" Neben der guten Wirkung auf den Körper ist Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Möglichkeit zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt abseits des Campus; fast so weit entfernt vom Campuszentrum wie einige Wohnheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Vorlesungen im Thomas Gebäude, das gut 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit einem Fahrrad kann ich diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich ordentlich in die Pedale trete. Das Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der schnellste Weg zu Thomas Building von meinem Haus aus ist und sie nicht immer ein einfacher Weg für Radfahrer ist. Es gibt auch etwas zu sagen für das Gehen, aber persönlich habe ich keine Zeit, zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre Gehen die einzige zuverlässige Möglichkeit, zu meinen Vorlesungen zu gelangen. Gehen zu Thomas jeden Tag würde mir zusätzliche 30-40 Minuten meines Tages rauben. Das ist mehr als zwei und ein halb Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kommen alle anderen Zeit, die ich für Gehen zu und von anderen Vorlesungen, Terminen und so weiter ausgeben müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich entbehren kann."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In pursuing a career in social work, I intend to follow a path in the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support for troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical behavior, commitment to improving relationships between others and to continually improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others but was unsure of the career path I wanted to take. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals fleeing from their problems through denial and some using coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Due to the situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent's residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents' house. There, I privately expressed my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was nothing the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and made excuses for their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in involving external sources to resolve \"simple\" disputes. After this experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother value important in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and mourn those who have been lost. The concept of the \"individual\" held by society is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like \"everyone else\"? I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to conform to others. Throughout my years in high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: by coloring my hair unnaturally, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "The following paper examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on inherited genetic information as well as medical aspects of health. The sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each selected study to better relate to and explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then criticized to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are dyssomnias or parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of substances. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is a difficulty in achieving or maintaining adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons that are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that animal models of mice can be generalized to human studies. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could alter the ability to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and everyday events that involve monotonous tasks and focus.",
            "Dieser Artikel deckt drei Bereiche des Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) ab. Zunächst wird eine kurze Definition der Erkrankung gegeben. Anschließend wird die Diagnose erklärt, einschließlich der häufigen Merkmale oder \"roten Fahnen\". Abschließend werden Wege beschrieben, wie ein Lehrer in einer inklusiven Klassensituation einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nCAPD, auch Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) genannt, bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditive Informationen verarbeitet. Enger definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung auditativer Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und zu elektrischen auditiven Potentialen führt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Erkrankung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem, also das Gehirn, normal gesprochene Dinge nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normal, sind also nicht als \"hörbehindert\" einzustufen; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der die gehörten Dinge analysiert und erkennt, nicht wie üblich.\n\nDie frühesten Erwähnungen der Erkrankung, die später als CAPD bekannt wurde, stammen aus den 1950er Jahren und wurden als \"auditory imperception\" bezeichnet (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine italienische Forschungsgruppe aus Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura die dichotische Testung und ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS ein, das der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz im Jahr 1977 förderte die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD.\n\nCAPD zeigt sich in verschiedenen Formen: Betroffene können Schwierigkeiten haben, Geräusche räumlich einzuordnen oder zu hören; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, zwei oder mehr \"akustische Ereignisse\" (Geräuschereignisse) zu unterscheiden; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, Muster in Geräuschen zu erkennen; sie können Schwierigkeiten haben, Sprachänderungen zu erkennen (wie z.B. das Erkennen von Ironie durch Änderung der Stimme); ein Geräusch kann durch ein folgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; sie könnten Schwierigkeiten haben, auditive Hinweise zu interpretieren und darauf zu reagieren; und sie könnten Schwierigkeiten haben, die Reihenfolge der auditiven Informationen zu bestimmen (Ferre).\n\nZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient systematisch auf sein Hörverhalten und/oder seine Leistung bei Tests der auditiven Funktion überprüft werden. Dies kann von Audiologen, Logopäden, Psychologen und anderen durchgeführt werden, die eine Vielzahl von Maßnahmen verwenden, um auditive Fähigkeiten zu bewerten. Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung auditiver Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktionen auf bestimmte Reize, gehören. Es gibt derzeit kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, das mit hoher Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit konsistent verwendet wird, und die Ursache der Erkrankung ist unbekannt. Viele verwendete Tests stellen dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitig vorliegende auditive Reize vor und fragen nach der Unterscheidung bestimmter Elemente wie einer Serie von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittene Tests umfassen die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to suggest that while disguise can indeed be useful for prolonged deception, in the end one must reject this newly assumed guise or risk losing oneself entirely. The problem with ending a deception, however, is that it may leave one feeling isolated. Therefore, in the end, one must choose between self-preservation and preserving relationships with those around them. While some may respond neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others will not take it lightly and may be offended by the whole charade.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender reversal is particularly problematic as it raises many secondary issues, with the most significant question being: Why? Why does one feel the need to shirk their own identity and take on a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is obviously a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Not only that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception can facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages hint that these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia secretly harbor feelings for women? One could argue that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those of his time who judge others solely based on their appearance.\n\nThis is evident in how easily Olivia switches her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",

            "The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters, most if not all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, which was then followed by sub-sub-genres, and the chain continues until today.\n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70’s that led to people getting crazier, leading to them to make crazy, other-worldly records, using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down, supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they put that song on The White Album.",
            "Before one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.",
            "Viele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer grundlegenden Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seinem Gedicht „Ode on a Grecian Urn“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit ist Schönheit – das ist alles, was auf Erden bekannt ist und alles, was man wissen muss.“ Vieles, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Dennoch scheinen wir Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, wie Keats andeutet, ohne sie auf diese Weise zu lernen. Beide, Ethik und Ästhetik, sind Versuche, zu beschreiben, nicht zu vorschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind in der Regel Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt ein Regelwerk zum Beurteilen oder Schaffen guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens zu sein.\nRelevanter noch: Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann nie vollständig das Wesentliche von Gutem oder Schönem erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert des Mona Lisa von da Vinci, zum Beispiel, könnte sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturelle Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Vielmehr, wenn man nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literaturwerk gefragt wird, ist es üblich, eine Phrase wie „Es gibt einfach etwas daran“ zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nicht vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Weise, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann … man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Erklärung unzureichend wäre.“ Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, es bleibt immer etwas Transzendentale. Ich glaube, dass Ethik ebenfalls diese Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. / . Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses ‚etwas‘, dieses Je ne sais quoi, ist, das die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir sie beide am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, um einen kantischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf einer Ebene, die erlebt werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie Robert McKean sagt: „Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was sie einzigartig macht, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es könnte sein, dass moralische Standards anderen Künsten wie der Musik nicht angemessen sind, aber sie scheinen so relevant für die Literatur wie für das Leben selbst zu sein. Leben notwendigerweise Werte zu integrieren …. Literatur ist uns wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir suchen.“",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful force, a unified country with a unique culture that can be felt from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is also evident in Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinct culture, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, has originated from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that it came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously called Germans before crossing the Rhine and battling the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars to distinguish between those he conquered (the Gauls) and those he didn't. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it comes from the Gaulish word for a neighbor, or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that \"I regard them [the Germans] as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet, at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and occasionally lead land campaigns but mostly returned to their sprawling empire. As Germanic tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army. (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17)",
            "I looked down, mind blankly comprehending the scene in front of me. Unemotionally, silently, I studied the object with practiced awareness, refusing to relate it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flickered into my mind and dissipated almost faster than they appeared. My consciousness worked so smoothly that it seemed I had no thoughts of my own, just a liquid experience of what I was observing.\nOnce, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw since I was six and this book teaches everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wants to study. Thus, a complex picture like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room is transformed into a simple, easily grasped image.\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the scene. I was so overwhelmed, so awestruck that I could only stand and gaze in wonder. Picasso went through his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters used a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of considering my perspective artistic, before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\nMy fingertips touched my chosen artistic tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will taking shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Matter flakes broke away from the whole and dissipated into nothingness. Muscles tightened, twitching and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand hit the toilet handle again. The offensive brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom.\nMop loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for the bath cleanup crew at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments, then my hand reached for the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping it tightly until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing tall, then bending at the waist, my hand slipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenager sterben hinter dem Steuer. Verschiedene Faktoren kommen zusammen und ergeben eine tödliche Statistik für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer. Das Nationale Institut für Gesundheit erklärt, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Teenagerhirn einfach nicht für die Gefahren des Fahrens bereit ist. Einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt auch am Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate an Überschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Straßenabfahrten.\n\nTeens haben es auch weit schwerer, wenn sie mit ihren Gleichaltrigen unterwegs sind – etwas, das jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center hat eine Studie durchgeführt, die die folgende Korrelation gezeigt hat: die Altersgruppe der Mitfahrer und die Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\n\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit der Teenagerfahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie eine provisorische Lizenz einführen, die die Fahrzeiten und die Mitfahrt von anderen Minderjährigen beschränkt.\n\nDiese provisorischen Fahrerlaubnisse sind jedoch, wie ich denke, nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem besteht darin, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe nach allen statistischen Indikatoren die Risiken und Verantwortungen nicht ausreichend bewältigen können. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 Jahre zu jung für eine reguläre Fahrerlaubnis ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungsergebnisse veröffentlicht hat, die einen Wunsch unter den 19-20-Jährigen zeigen, Risiken für den reinen Kick aus dem Gefühl des Risikos einzugehen. Es macht daher Sinn, das Fahren mindestens bis zu dem Zeitpunkt zu verzögern, an dem der Wunsch nach Risikoerfahrungen nachgelassen hat. Wenn wir weiterhin Fahrerlaubnisse an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Todesopferzahl wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich in erschreckenden Ausmaßen steigen. Bis 2010 werden die Kinder der Baby-Boomer Generation das Fahrtziel erreichen, und Millionen neuer Teenagerfahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\n\nGesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre angemessen einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulkurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Motorfahrzeug führen. Eine vorläufige Erlaubnis könnte weiterhin vor der Ausstellung einer vollständigen Fahrerlaubnis ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden wäre weiterhin erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Grundlage der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Bundesstaaten gefordert wird (in Kalifornien beträgt diese Anzahl derzeit 6 Stunden praktische Fahrzeit und 50 Stunden mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken der Teenagerfahrer auf einer Vielzahl von Bundesstaaten basieren, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema eine vernünftige – und ich glaube, auch wirksame – Maßnahme, um Teenager in ganz Amerika zu schützen.\n\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.",
            "In examining the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outliers present in a few of the later films. For the most part, trick films at the turn of the century were stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, featured no camera movement, used long and medium shots, and adhered to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are a few films from the early 20th century that dared to break these guidelines by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable common aspects of trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This was borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups do not occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be composed of several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Take a close look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor von Caroline war ein früher und eifriger Befürworter des Republikanismus. Trotz seiner Haupttätigkeit als Landwirt, die gemeinsam mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere dazu führte, dass er als ein Mann bekannt wurde, der sich leidenschaftlich für persönliche Freiheit und Regierung einsetzte. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Ansichten über die Regierung. Es war sein Bestreben, das, was er für die vorzüglichste aller Berufe hielt, zu bewahren und zu fördern, das seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Rechtssystem färbte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu entwickeln, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was die Schaffung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängen – das bedeutet, dass, wenn einem verweigert wird, dann alle scheitern und der Wert der verbleibenden erschüttert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige als „Naturzustand“ bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen, die über körperliche Stärke und böse Intelligenz verfügten, profitierten, aber in einer Zivilisation sollte dies nicht der Fall sein.\n\nUm dieses ideale Gesellschaftssystem zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung entwickelt werden müsse, die die intrinsische Gutheit und Bösartigkeit des Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr strikt in seinen Ansichten zu einer dualistischen Moral. Er sagte: „Da die Regierung durch den Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein“ (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und Kapitalismus abschrecken. Er glaubte, dass eine in guten Prinzipien gegründete Regierung fair funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Administration, die zwangsläufig von Habgier und Eigennutz geprägt wäre. Eigennutz, so glaubte er, ist der Antrieb des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber er wird nur böse, wenn er sich von der Schaffung einer auf dem öffentlichen Wohl basierenden Gesellschaft zu Subgesellschaften entwickelt, die auf Kosten anderer leben. Eine gute Regierung sei notwendig, um die natürliche Bosheit des Menschen in Schach zu halten, und selbst dann müsse sie unter strenger Beobachtung stehen, um das Hinzufügen schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, plädierte für eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung, der keine weiteren Rechte oder Befugnisse als die in der Verfassung ausdrücklich genannten zugestanden würden. Er wusste, dass eine ausgedehnte Bundesregierung teuer und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch wäre. Allerdings glaubte er, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich sei und ohne den Bezug auf den Willen der Schriftsteller leicht korrupt werden könne. Noch mehr, er betrachtete die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als das wahre Grundgesetz der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land klarer als eine Gruppe von souveränen Staaten als eine Nation beschreibt.",
            "Bezugnehmend auf Figur 17 gab es im dritten Monat des Projekts einen dramatischen Rückgang der Einreichungen der Pendlerprotokolle. Das war ein wenig enttäuschend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters an einer Campus im New England zeigt sich claramente ein Rückgang an Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß zur Arbeit kommen, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, in dem alle sehr beschäftigt sind, um Hausaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls könnte für viele einfach aus dem Blickfeld geraten sein. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember den Beginn der hektischen Feiertagssaison und die damit verbundene monatelange Pause für Studenten und Mitarbeiter, in der viele nicht einmal zur Campus kommen müssen. Der Unterricht beginnt dann wieder für das Frühlings Trimester Ende Januar, was möglicherweise auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl der Protokolle für diesen Monat ist. Jedoch erklärt das die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar nicht. Man könnte vermuten, dass ein Projekt dieser Art zunächst einen Anstieg an Energie und Aufregung erlebt, der dann möglicherweise natürlisch abnimmt. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die „Carpool Challenge Week“ ins Leben gerufen, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Projekt wieder zu beflügeln, was zu einer Erhöhung der Protokolleinreichungen für diesen Monat führte. Somit war eines der Herausforderungen, die wir bei diesem Projekt (oder einem alternativen Pendelprojekt) erlebten, wie man das Projektmomentum trotz eines natürlichen Rückgangs an Engagement aufrechterhält, aber auch spezifisch die Problematik von Feiertagen und Semesterpausen im Hochschulbereich. Eine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder ein alternatives Pendelprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens schätzen. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es entscheidend, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Pendelmodalitäten zu schaffen. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagesalons, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Ketten ausgegeben. Es wäre interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie größere Preise die Teilnahme beeinflusst hätten – wie zum Beispiel das Verteilen eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybride- oder Elektroautos. Das hätte auch helfen können, dem Rückgang an Engagement entgegenzuwirken, den das Projekt erlebte. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Projekts nicht. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts erhöht worden wären, das könnte geholfen haben. Die Geschenkgutscheine schienen am Anfang des Projekts völlig ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung einiger Fahrräder und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybride- oder Elektroautos angekündigt hätten, könnte man nur denken, dass das Teilnehmen und das Engagement gestiegen wäre, anstatt abzunehmen.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction.  Although these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another advantage of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\n\tTo evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, so we have decided to include only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tTo gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio were made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart, it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\n\tTo evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors.\n\nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”. The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem.\n\nGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.",

Um einen Anspruch auf die Verurteilung von Strafschadensersatz zu erheben, muss der Kläger Beweise vorlegen, dass die Handlungen des Beklagten absichtlich und bewusst mit dem Ziel begangen wurden, wahrscheinlich auftretenden Schaden zu verursachen, sowie dass die Handlung verabscheuungswürdig war. Palmer kann argumentieren, dass Martin die wahrscheinlich gefährdende Situation der Pfütze kennen musste, da sich in den Monaten vor ihrem Unfall mehrere Kund:innen von D&D durch Ausrutschen verletzt hatten; und trotz dieses Wissens die Pfütze nicht entfernt wurde. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verabscheuungswürdig waren, ist weniger überzeugend, ist aber dennoch gerechtfertigt gegeben die Fakten, dass sechs Ausrutschunghandlungen im Jahr 2009 aufgetreten sind und Martin dennoch keine angemessenen Maßnahmen ergriffen hat, um die Sicherheit seines Ladens zu gewährleisten.\n\nAm 13. Oktober 2009 um 17:00 Uhr informierte ein Mitarbeiter von D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, seinen Vorgesetzten, Paul Martin, über eine Obstmusspfütze in einem Gang. Martin sagte Wayne, dass er auf der Essenspause sei und \"keine Zeit für Kundenbeschwerden\" habe. Um 17:15 Uhr informierte ihn eine weitere Mitarbeiterin, Mary J. Haddigan, ebenfalls über die Pfütze, und Martin reagierte ähnlich. Um 17:30 Uhr am Dreizehnten rutschte die Klägerin, Jennifer Palmer, auf der Pfütze aus und erlitt eine schwere Rückenverletzung. Vor Palmers Unfall waren im Jahr 2009 fünf verschiedene Ausrutschhandlungen in D&D gemeldet worden. Palmer verklagt D&D nun auf Entschädigung und Strafschadensersatz wegen ihrer Verletzung und wir untersuchen, ob eine teilweise Zusammenfassung für den Strafschadensersatzanspruch eingereicht werden soll.\n\nIn Kalifornien kann ein Kläger für eine Pflichtverletzung, die nicht aus einem Vertrag hervorgeht, Strafschadensersatz erhalten, wenn der Beklagte \"Drangsalierung, Betrug oder Bosheit\" begangen hat.

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally observed mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nThere are also some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of 'witness' or of how people 'on their own' converted to Islam. But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third-party perspective. That is, in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc. I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these different techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby\". Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In his novel \"The Great Gatsby\" F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and red/pink, and then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an important object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit nicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the beginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring many common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community-supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while improving habitat, thus permitting recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and other programs for generating income or educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area due to the lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often has greater costs than conventional farming. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Therefore, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "**\n\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective.",
            "Der Narr hat in seinem Herzen gesagt: „Es gibt keinen Gott.“ Dieser Gedanke erscheint erstmals im Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und ist der Beginn von St. Anselms Argumentation zur Existenz Gottes. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch der andere Autor, Thomas Aquinas, zu teilen, den wir diskutieren werden. Da beide ihre Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts vorbringen und unsere Aufgabe darin besteht, festzustellen, welche der beiden besser ist, müssen wir aus praktischen Gründen voraussetzen, dass sie beide in ihrer Überzeugung, dass es den Gott der Bibel gibt, richtig liegen. Ein Gott-Typus, der sich von dem unterscheidet, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht gestatten, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie beide im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung einer bestimmten Gottesvorstellung stehen. Es sei jedoch gesagt, dass ich glaube, dass beide Autoren zwar berechtigte Punkte bringen, aber keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\nUm dies zu veranschaulichen, untersuchen wir nun das Grundargument von St. Anselm. Anselms Passage beschreibt einen Weg der Erkenntnis durch den Glauben, indem man in sich selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass Gott in unserem Verstand existiert, sodass wir seine Nicht-Existenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während seine Argumentation in seiner Terminologie oft ermüdend und unklar ist, besteht die Hauptaussage darin, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht hinausgehen müssen über die Grenzen unserer Seele, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens in der Wahrheit liegt, die wir ohnehin innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes kennen. Außerevidenz sei angeblich nicht notwendig. Dieses Konzept, etwas zu akzeptieren, für das es keinen unbestrittenen empirischen Beleg gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\nDies ist ein sehr anderer Standpunkt als der von St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas meint, dass sich die Existenz Gottes durch reinen Verstand und empirische Beweise beweisen lässt, ohne dass Glaube notwendig ist. Eine solche Vorstellung wäre vorteilhaft für das Evangelisieren, ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Christentums, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von deren Bereitschaft, etwas Unbewiesenes zu akzeptieren, ermöglichen würde. Sie könnten stattdessen durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes beweisen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grade des Vorzugs und Harmonie. In jedem dieser Argumente zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man dir sagt, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du den Rest des Puzzles zusammenstellst, so diktiert die Logik, dass du die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Puzzleteils ohne es zu sehen kennen kannst.",
            "**\n\nSometime zwischen dem 5. und 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der später als Buddha bekannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens verließ er die Welt und erlangte Erleuchtung, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus – der am traditionellsten Orthodoxe davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddha-Zeiten. Dies zeigt sich überall, etwa in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasserritzfeier begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen daran teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nichts dergleichen gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von superfiziellen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinschaft, sowohl aus klösterlicher als auch aus layperspektiver Sicht, musste ihre doctrinalen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies kann auf innere und äußere, feindliche und wohlwollende Einflüsse zurückgeführt werden.\n\nEs gibt einige Begriffe, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Ein innerer Faktor wird als ein Faktor definiert, der von den Anhängern des Buddhismus stammt, unabhängig von ihrem status. Ein äußerer Faktor ist jeder Faktor von Nicht-Buddhisten. Ein feindlicher Faktor ist jeder Faktor, der der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder ihr schaden will – ein Faktor, der aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Ein wohlwollender Faktor ist ein Faktor, der die Buddhistengemeinde nicht schaden oder ihr helfen will, obwohl er dies möglicherweise als Nebenwirkung tut. Diese Begriffe werden im Laufe dieser Diskussion häufig vorkommen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Schutz in den drei Juwelen des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus der Tripitaka – den drei Körben – der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka die disziplinären Regeln, und der Abhidhamma Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Konzepte umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – kein Selbst, Dukkha – das Leiden im Leben, und Anicca – die Vergänglichkeit alles. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Geburt und Tod, beenden, der unaufhörlich geschieht. Mit Sansara werden auch Lobha – Gelüste, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden die Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, Ich werde nicht lügen, Ich werde nicht stehlen, Ich werde mich nicht unzüchtig verhalten und Ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinäre Regeln. Der fundamentale doctrinale Begriff in Buddhism ist der Begriff der vier heiligen Wahrheiten. Erstens Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n**",
            "The United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which were once plagued by a long-lasting rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as major conflicts of interest (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not unique; many nations have enduring rivalries with their neighbors. Nations sharing a border often have conflicting interests that lead to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are no different from many other enduring rivalries between neighboring nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American nations have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues created a divide between the two nations, a problem that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that \"if in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Not unlike the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was part ideological struggle and part competition for vital interests, the ideological struggles between the U.S. and Mexico were based on religious preferences rather than political structures. This distrust stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their former colonial rulers, which was a significant obstacle in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, revolved around territorial issues such as border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from U.S. border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both countries exerted military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and finally ended when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the nineteenth century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suddenly and unexpectedly became disabled by an illness I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply ingrained need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So – even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a little of both – I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, here I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but there is one thing that I know to be true: I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life – big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on their own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again – learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than having each of us individually scrambling out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food – do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms\", the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively static over the last ten years. While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015. The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target. That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done. In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%. The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue. While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural. This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country. Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas. Another issue of access concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\nIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child. There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results. There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period. Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "Vor ein paar Jahren arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, in dem ich Grundschüler in verschiedenen Fächern unterrichtete. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen zu helfen, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englischen und im Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen. Adrian war entweder in der dritten oder vierten Klasse und hatte große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen. Irgendwann fiel mir auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte: Er konnte einige Buchstaben perfekt aussprechen, andere aber überhaupt nicht. Er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war sicher, aber er sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich war beim Babysitten für einige wenige Kinder, während der Rest der Gruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als sie hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr begrenztem Spanisch-Kenntnissen konnten wir kommunizieren. Dann fiel es mir wie ein Schlag auf den Kopf: Adrian konnte gut lesen, aber er kannte die englische Alphabet nicht besonders gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe doch, dass es ihm besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um auf das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, einzugehen. Auch um zu zeigen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann beim Lesen noch große Schwierigkeiten haben. Ich bin sicher, dass jeder mit diesem Problem konfrontiert ist, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Lesetraining in Englisch, insbesondere das Alphabet und die Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Der Dual-Language-System, die Hauptimmersion, private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Maßnahmen allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt in der Kombination all dieser Elemente!\n\nZunächst einmal: Das Dual-Language-System ist eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in Zweisprachenschulen haben sich akademisch besser entwickelt als ihre Altersgenossen.\" Viele haben Angst vor dieser Idee, dass sie eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die meisten Kinder in der Schule davon keinen Nutzen haben. Das ist aber falsch. Wenn wir solche Programme in der Schule als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie erreichen wir das? Möchten wir alle Lehrer bilingual? Nein, das wäre unrealistisch und überfordert. Aber ich denke, es gibt keinen Grund, warum wir nicht spezialisierte Helfer und Tutoren haben könnten, die bilingual sind.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are taught that there is something out there that is greater than we are, that is beyond our comprehension. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to church or search within ourselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and adopt another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, his gaze both searching and remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely from his body. His hair was sparser than I remembered. He stared out into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months beyond the doctors’ predictions. What the value was in him merely suffering longer, I could not comprehend. What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "Die traditionelle \"Gothic Novel\" ist im Kern und im Namen ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neue,'\" wie Ian Watt es in 'The Rise of the Gothic Novel' beschreibt. Der Gothic-Modus wurde verunglimpft, gelobt, der Unrealität vorgeworfen und für das 'Schreckliche Erhabene' gelobt, das er zu erzeugen schien (Burke). Die ursprüngliche \"Gothic Novel,\" Horaces Walpoles 'The Castle of Otranto,' nutzte die Ideen sowohl der 'alten' als auch der 'modernen' Romane, um das proto-Gothic Genre zu schaffen und eine neue Methode der literarischen Ausdrucksweise. Walpole verwendet 'alte' theatralische Elemente und 'neue' Nachahmung der Natur in 'modernen' Romanen, um eine \"Gothic Story\" zu präsentieren (Walpole 4). Die Gothic-Genre nutzt viele Elemente der mittelalterlichen gothischen Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Selbst zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung von 'The Castle of Otranto' wurde das Wort 'gothic' verwendet, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeitperioden zu beschreiben. Es wurde als veraltet odersimpel angesehen im Vergleich zur 'modernen' gesellschaftlichen und literarischen 'Fortschritt'. Die Kombination der mehr theatralischen 'Gothic' und des neuen Formats des Romans (das dem Leser einen persönlicheren Einblick in die Psychologie der Charaktere ermöglicht) ist es, was Gothic dazu ermöglicht, so lange zu bestehen und gleichzeitig veraltet und neu für einen Leser zu erscheinen, der weit zurückliegend zur ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung ist.\n\nEine der prominentesten Ideen der Gothic-Novels ist das Konzept des Rittertums. Das mittelalterliche Ideal des Rittertums, der Prozess der Erziehung eines richtigen Ritters, wird in der ursprünglichen Gothic-Noel 'The Castle of Otranto' sowohl beibehalten als auch transformiert. Rittertum ist für Gothic-Autoren besonders wichtig, weil es das klassische Ideal des Ritters repräsentiert, tapfer, ehrenhaft, fähig – und den vermeintlichen oder wahrgenommenen Mangel dieses Ideals in der Gesellschaft, die die Autoren (besonders Walpole) sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird das 'gothische Vergangene' idealisiert und verromantisiert (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) und wird verwendet, um den gegenwärtigen Zustand verbessern zu wollen. Walpole schrieb 'The Castle of Otranto' inmitten politischer Unruhen und war über die mögliche Zukunft verzweifelt. Er, eingebettet in die Politik und (debatably) ungerechtfertigten Beschuldigungen, begann möglicherweise sogar, wenn auch nicht explizit, zu denken, dass die vermeintliche Moral und innere 'Güte' in den Menschen, die in der gothischen Ära vorhanden waren, auf eine Weise verloren gegangen waren in den Individuen, die die 'gegenwärtige' Gesellschaft bildeten. In seinem Schreiben ist diese Idee klar in mehreren Charakteren zu sehen, einem davon ist die Figur Frederic. Dem Leser wird vor dem Treffen von Frederic klar, dass er viele ritterliche Eigenschaften verkörpert, er wird beschrieben als:\n\nDie Beschreibung umfasst viele traditionelle ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist, zuerst, ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, war geeignet von Tragik, die er verlässt, und ist derzeit angenommen worden, von Ungläubigen getötet worden. Die Figur des 'galanten und höflichen Ritters' ist, natürlich, übertrieben, bringend den baldigen Gothic-Tropus des Exzesses ins Spiel (66).",
            "Die Supply Chain Management ist der Strom von Prozessen, bei denen Waren von der Kundennachfrage bis zur Rohstoffphase, Beschaffung, Produktion und Verteilung von Produkten an den Kunden fließen. Der Begriff Supply Chain Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, geprägt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Supply Chain abläuft, um die Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu befriedigen. Zu einer Supply Chain gehören sechs zentrale Elemente: Produktion, Beschaffung, Lagerhaltung, Lage, Transport und Information. Geschäftsführer nutzen diese sechs wesentlichen Elemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um dies zu erfahren, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator dafür, welche Nachfrage besteht. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert und in welcher Menge sie produziert werden sollen. Nach der Entscheidung der Verwaltung, welche Produkte und in welcher Menge produziert werden sollen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert und in welcher Anlage die beste Produktionsmenge und -qualität gewährleistet wird, unter Berücksichtigung der Kundenbedürfnisse und -zufriedenheit. Nach der Entscheidung über den Produktionsstandort der Produkte konzentriert sich das Management auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Instandhaltung der Ausrüstung. Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Jedes Detail ist von Bedeutung. Wenn jedes Detail nicht entsprechend geplant wird, kann es dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben für jede Einheit des Geschäfts ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess. Es gibt ein entworfenes Layout dafür, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, wenn er eine Lieferung von LKWs entgegennimmt. Ausgearbeitete Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung in Bezug auf Richtung und Erwartungen zu haben.\n\nDas zweite zentrale Element der Supply Chain Management ist die Beschaffung. Beschaffung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden müssen, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung und Partnerschaften zur Zusammenarbeit zu bestimmen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsdivisionen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Divisionen bestehen aus verschiedenen Ausrüstungen, Mitarbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Division am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Die Verwaltung kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, um Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit bedeutet die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten, während gleichzeitig Kosten gesenkt oder niedrige Kosten beibehalten werden.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Der Nachlass von Duke Ellington in der Jazzmusik basiert zum großen Teil auf seiner Langlebigkeit und seiner kreativen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu gestalten. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, als Komponist jedoch überragte er beim Schaffen von reichhaltigen und komplexen Werken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorhoben. Er schuf ein Framework, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, gleichzeitig schrieb er eng getaktete Stücke und Phrasen, die das besondere Spiel der Bandmitglieder herausstellten, um musikalische Ideen zu betonen. Dies ermöglichte es ihm auch, den Klang des Orchesters insgesamt zu betonen und kohärente und originelle Klänge für jedes Stück zu erstellen. Ellingtons Meisterhaftigkeit in der Nutzung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler sowie ihrer Zusammensetzung als wachsendes Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillanten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\nThe Grove Music dictionary erwähnt in der Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation \"Creole Love Call\" als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme als Jazzinstrument während seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Lyrics behindert zu werden. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere ziehen lässt. Dieses langsame, bedächtige Twelve-Bar-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chorusse:\nChorus 1: Ein Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und dann zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nChorus 2: Ein gedämpftes Trompeten-Solo, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere verlängerte Blue Notes betont.\nChorus 3: Ein übergreifendes Klarinettensolo in einem hohen Register, das von einer subtilen syncopierten Klaviereinlage begleitet wird.\nChorus 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call and Response der Blech- und Holzbläser.\nChorus 5: Der klimaktische Chorus des Stücks, bei dem die Holzbläser jetzt das Call and Response in einem hohen Register beginnen, unterstützt von einem syncopierten Stop-Time von Blech- und Rhythmusabteilung.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Choruses, mit einem Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus übernimmt die Stimme den Sound der \"growl\" Technik und soliert als Instrument.\nTag: Ein kurzer Tag mit einer Vocal-Run und einem dissonanten Novität-Einsatz des Trompeten.\nEllingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine Dimension an Klangfarbe zu geben, ist ein Beispiel für einen stilistischen Zug, der seine gesamte Arbeit durchzieht.\nIn \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarbe. Ein Call and Response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox’ Scat-Singen nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley’s Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’ Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu schaffen. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" entwickelt diese Ideen weiter, da Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine festen Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Trompete einzuführen.",
            "She had always felt like something was missing. This desire refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, getting into a teenage life. And it was still there three years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had decided she wanted someone rather than something. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, made awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She often questioned herself with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived her life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and, oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own life, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch... sweet, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by a higher intake of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, and a lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies found an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial showed that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 U.S. states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained their participation over the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounders (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America suffered a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America's largest and most important corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must ask: how did this crisis occur, and how can we prevent it? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans to an already immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserves and transferred this chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 in the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term. To boost his popularity, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately foretold the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the economy's collapse.\n\nMany factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general to over-leverage themselves in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left high and dry. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you spread your literary wings and take flight, astonishing all with your magnetic, nay magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was \"live\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned.\n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" so that you would stay tuned.\n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual amount of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was.\n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story.",
            "Es gibt eine Verbindung zwischen Brüdern; eine unzerbrechliche, unumkehrbare Verbindung. In dieser Verbindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Neid und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere in einer solchen Verbindung, und sie können sich nur in ihrem Bruder sehen. Es ist in den brenzligsten Situationen, dass die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es zum Guten oder Bösen. Wenn diese Gefühle sich zeigen, tragen sie eine große Last mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geborenen Gefühle besteht darin, mit den Konsequenzen umzugehen, die sie nach sich ziehen. Wenn jemand seinem Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und in diesem Menschen sein eigenes Spiegelbild erkennt, sieht er sich nicht so, wie andere ihn sehen, sondern so, wie er wirklich ist. In seinen Taten und den Folgen dieser Taten liegt sein wahres Wesen. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Gefühle, die es begleiten. Auf einer üppigen, lebendig beschriebenen Landschaft machen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine fruchtlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung prallt auf intensive Stolz im Höhepunkt der Geschichte, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten Doodle und ihre Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers ausgedrückt, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seinen Blick auf die Welt um ihn herum übermittelt, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen einwirken.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf ein Schlüsselgefühl zurückführen: Stolz. Von dem Moment, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, zum ersten Mal zusammen ausgingen, bis zu ihrer letzten, entscheidenden Expedition, empfindet der Protagonist Resignation gegenüber Doodle. Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, den er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten lehren konnte, wie \"…den Atem anhalten, rennen, springen oder klettern in Old Woman Swamp…\" Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, der die Rolle eines \"…Partners zum Rennen nach Horsehead Landing…und jemand, um sich mit ihm auf dem obersten Ast der großen Kiefer hinter dem Schuppen zu setzen…\" spielen konnte. Natürlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, da Doodle mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen zur Welt gekommen ist, was es unwahrscheinlich macht, dass er überlebt. Selbst wenn er wahrscheinlich nie an anstrengenden körperlichen Aktivitäten teilnehmen könnte. Was für eine Enttäuschung für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilden Träumen war, dass all diese Träume in einem Moment zerschlagen werden. Er wird sogar gezeigt, dass er einige Wut auf das kleine Kind hat, als er zurückdenkt, dass er begann, über das Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu überlegen. Welches Kind würde solch einen Gedanken haben? Aber sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so einfache Tat gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. In seinem Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.",

Bei der Erforschung des Gehirns sollten die Grenzen und potenziellen Fehlerbehaftetheit dieser Metaphern berücksichtigt werden.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit der Eingabe der Sinnesorgane, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl von unten nach oben als auch von oben nach unten verarbeitet. Zum Beispiel, wenn man ein Bild eines schwarzen Kastens auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachtet, verarbeitet die untere Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Ausrichtung und wo die Objektgrenzen liegen – wo sich die Farbänderungen über einen kurzen Raum schnell ändern – um zu entscheiden, dass man einen Kasten sieht. Die obere Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der unteren Verarbeitung getroffen wurden, um das Erkennen des Kastens zu beschleunigen. Die obere Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, den Gegenstand als schwarzen Kasten und nicht als eine kastenförmige Öffnung im weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\nSobald Informationen in einem bestimmten Maße verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Aufmerkensfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zugänglich gemacht werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet das Gehirn jede Grashalme, wenn man auf seine Schuhe schaut, aber ein gesunder Aufmerkensfilter verhindert, dass man sie einzeln bemerkt. Im Gegensatz dazu könnte man seinen Namen, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird, heraushören. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit immer wieder modifiziert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, müssen sie zunächst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Gedächtnis, darunter sensorisches, Arbeitsgedächtnis und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zunächst wird die Information codiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von sensorischen Reizen sind. Zum Beispiel kann verbaler Input strukturell kodiert werden, was bedeutet, wie das gedruckte Wort aussieht, phonemisch, was bedeutet, wie das Wort klingt, oder semantisch, was bedeutet, was das Wort bedeutet. Sobald die Information gespeichert ist, muss sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch eine elektrische Signalschleife in einer bestimmten Reihe von Neuronen für eine kurze Zeit aufrechterhalten wird. Die Information im Langzeitgedächtnis wird darin vermutet, dass sie in der Struktur bestimmter Proteintypen aufrechterhalten wird.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basierend auf der Art und Weise, wie Menschen Erinnerungen abrufen, andere basierend auf der Informatik und wieder andere basierend auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verbunden sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk \"Stuhl\" mit \"Tisch\" verbunden sein, der wiederum mit \"Holz\" verbunden sein könnte und so weiter.",
            "Aldous Huxley kritisiert die aufkommende Bedrohung sowohl durch Technologie als auch durch das kapitalistische System, durch das es verstärkt wird, indem eine Dystopie in dem Roman Brave New World erschaffen wird. Die Menschen dort schätzen Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an so konditioniert, dass sie das sofortige Glück über alles andere stellen. Die Bürger sind somit nur Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel, das von einem World Controller vorgegeben wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes unter dem Blickwinkel des Marxismus zeigt sich die Skepsis des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung solcher Systeme. Begriffe, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, aus dem Marxismus verstärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Mängeln der aufkommenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Marxistische These der falschen Bewusstseinssatire kritisiert. Dies bedeutet, dass die gewöhnlichen Bürger die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen nicht kennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihren eigenen Vorteilen interessiert sind. Dies wird durch die ideologische Kontrolle der Arbeiterklasse und der einfachen Arbeiter verursacht, was im Brave New World durch die Konditionierung der Bevölkerung deutlich wird. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keine echte eigene Willenskraft; durch Hypnopädie wird der Konsum, das Ausgeben und das Genießen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, ist hier offensichtlich. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst, sondern kaufen förmlich eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (also Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen sind geboren mit dem Wissen darüber, tun aber nichts; wenige Alphas oder Betas, wie z.B. Bernard, tun mehr als nur ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen zwischen den sozialen Schichten, wie weiter unten diskutiert, deutliche Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung durch den Kapitalismus.\n\nIn Brave New World gibt es keine Beziehungen zwischen disparaten Individuen. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden – auch bei den Hauptcharakteren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley damit sagen, dass die Aufwärtsentwicklung von Technologie und Kapitalismus dem Menschen seine Freiheit und seinen Ausdruck nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme einer einzigen Emotion; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, deutliche dargestellt durch die Männerremarks über Frauen, die hauptsächlich auf ihrer körperlichen Attraktivität basieren, und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Erfahrungen. Zudem zeigt die Komplizenhaftigkeit der jeweiligen sozialen Schicht in ihrer Stellung in der Hierarchie die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsamkeit gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den Marxistischen Gedanken über die Arbeiterklasse, die falsch in ihrer eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere versichert werden, solange sie weiter konsumieren, gehorchen und in der Reihe mit den anderen bleiben.",
            "Ich bin nun seit etwa zwei und ein halb Jahren Student an der Universität Park, oder seit vier und ein halb Semestern. Für viele, einschließlich mir, ist es ein Problem, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls Wohnheim untergebracht; fast der östlichste Punkt des Campus, außer dem Stadion und dem Bryce Jordan Center. Von meinem Zuhause in Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen an weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard Gebäude, nicht weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt, konnte es bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. Ein ehemaliger Student, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, рассказал mir, dass die East Halls Wohnheime nicht lange her nicht vom Rest der Schule durch große ungenutzte Grundstücke getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern, großen neuen Gebäuden einschließlich des neuen Käsereis und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstungsgebäude und von Wohnungen umgeben. Während unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss auf die Bedürfnisse von Radfahrern zugeschnitten sein.\n\nIch habe mit einem Freund gesprochen, der kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder angefangen hat, Fahrrad zu fahren. Er sagte, er habe sich gefragt, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrräder sind großartig,\" sagte er, \"es war eine Weile nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die einzige Möglichkeit, sich fortzubewegen.\" Neben der guten Wirkung auf den Körper ist Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Möglichkeit zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt abseits des Campus; fast so weit entfernt vom Campuszentrum wie einige Wohnheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Vorlesungen im Thomas Gebäude, das gut 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit einem Fahrrad kann ich diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich ordentlich in die Pedale trete. Das Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der schnellste Weg zu Thomas Building von meinem Haus aus ist und sie nicht immer ein einfacher Weg für Radfahrer ist. Es gibt auch etwas zu sagen für das Gehen, aber persönlich habe ich keine Zeit, zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre Gehen die einzige zuverlässige Möglichkeit, zu meinen Vorlesungen zu gelangen. Gehen zu Thomas jeden Tag würde mir zusätzliche 30-40 Minuten meines Tages rauben. Das ist mehr als zwei und ein halb Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kommen alle anderen Zeit, die ich für Gehen zu und von anderen Vorlesungen, Terminen und so weiter ausgeben müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich entbehren kann."
