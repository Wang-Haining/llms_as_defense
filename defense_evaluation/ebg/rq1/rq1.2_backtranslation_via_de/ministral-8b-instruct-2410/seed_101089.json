            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The following paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited, as well as the medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to highlight their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in falling or staying asleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is defined by difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep episodes. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice showed that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that animal models of mice can be generalized to human studies. This indicates that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could affect the ability to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and daily events that involve monotonous tasks and focus.",
            "This paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n(CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that although disguise can be useful for prolonged deception, ultimately one must shed this new identity or risk losing oneself. The challenge of ending a deception is the risk of isolation, as one must decide between self-preservation and maintaining relationships. While some may accept the deception, others will be deeply offended.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises many issues, with the most significant being the motivation. Why does the subject feel the need to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it’s clear it's a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nUpon arriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from the women, cutting her off from a crucial support system. To make matters worse, her convincing portrayal as a man leads Olivia to confuse her with Sebastian and fall in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must deal with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this might seem progressive to a modern reader, Twelfth Night may also illustrate how deception can uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Certain passages suggest they might have unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia secretly harbor feelings for women? One might argue that this is unlikely, as Olivia seems more likely to judge others based solely on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Die deutsche Kolonialherrschaft wurde von verschiedenen Beobachtern für ihre Brutalität, insbesondere aufgrund des Völkermords an den Ovaherero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika, kritisiert. Natürlich kann ein so umfassendes Kolonialreich wie das deutsche nicht mit einer einfachen Beschreibung erklärt werden. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen Politiken und seiner Herrschaftsform so vielfältig wie in seiner Geografie. Die Bildungseinrichtungen in den Kolonien waren ebenfalls sehr unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 die Herrschaft über Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganyika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Zahl von gebildeten und alphabetisierten Afrikanern vor. Die deutschen Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heutiges Namibia) bot einen starken Kontrast. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen einrichtete und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der Bildung der Eingeborenen in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den Missionarsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete und die Missionars Schools stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese BildungsPolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien über erhebliche Zahlen an alphabetisierten und gebildeten Afrikanern verfügten, blieb die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch. Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu dieser unterschiedlichen Erfahrung in Südwestafrika. Dieser Artikel soll die Diskussion erweitern, indem er diese Faktoren identifiziert und insbesondere auf neue Forschung zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den Eingeborenen eingeht.\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zum Thema Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und stammen aus dem frühen 20. Jahrhundert, entweder während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft. Die frühen Werke hatten hauptsächlich das Ziel, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Werke in englischer Sprache erweiterten die Diskussion durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Die prominenteste Arbeit, die sich explizit mit dem Thema dieses Artikels befasst, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Nach Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung in Südwestafrika viele der unterscheidenden Merkmale des Kolonialsystems.\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen Kolonialbesitzungen Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein gemäßigt gemäßertes Klima, obwohl ein großer Teil des Gebiets von ariden Wüsten bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten etwa 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößeren Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.",
            "Die Einteilung der Populärmusik hat sich in den letzten 100 Jahren so stark weiterentwickelt, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres vollständig aufzulisten. Die Sache wird noch komplizierter durch die Tatsache, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – wie Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen – zahlreiche Unter- und Unteruntergenres innerhalb ihrer Sphäre hervorgebracht haben. Das Untergenre Heavy Metal Rock hat sich in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielseitigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der Populärmusik entwickelt. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es eine breite Palette an Emotionen zeigt, die jedoch oft dunkler Natur sind. Es ist vielseitig, weil die Menschen sehr früh erkannten, dass der Heavy Metal eine große Flexibilität bietet, die sie nutzen konnten, um eigene Unter- und Unteruntergenres zu schaffen, was bis heute weitergeht.\n\nHeute haben wir im Heavy Metal eine so große Vielfalt an Nischengruppen erreicht, dass es schwierig ist, genau zu sagen, was Heavy Metal eigentlich ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres integriert, aber wie alles andere hat es auch Wurzeln. Um die heutige Metal-Musik zu verstehen, muss man erst einmal verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert wird. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehrs“ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivität, mehr Fähigkeiten; die Musiker in Metal-Bands können wirklich gut spielen, und das hört man in der Musik. Metal ist auch, wie es wahrscheinlich kaum überraschend ist, eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen geprägt ist. Es gab in der Mitte der 70er Jahre eine psychedelische Drogenwelle, die die Menschen verrückter machte, was dazu führte, dass sie verrückte, andereweltliche Platinen aufnahmen, wobei die Drogen als Entschuldigung für ihre Schöpfung dienten. Es hat viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, was damals im Musikleben neu war, da eine große Menge an beliebter Musik Qualitäten hatte, die nicht dem dunklen Teil des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Spätere Generationen des Metals haben auch einige Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten, die so in der Romantik Ära vorhanden waren. Lyrics wie die folgenden drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Zeilen aus Helter Skelter zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Es stellt einen Auf und Ab dar, das angeblich von Drogen verursacht wurde. Dieses Lied wird von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy Metal Lieder betrachtet. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Lied der Rolling Stones, das auch schwerer und dunkler war. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer klingen konnten wie die Stones, und so brachten sie dieses Lied auf das Weiße Album.",
            "Einige Jahrzehnte vor den Surrealisten begannen, ihre traumhaften Werke zu malen, war Henri Rousseau damit beschäftigt, seine eigenen Träume, sowohl wörtlich als auch metaphorisch, zu erschaffen. \"Der Traum\", ein 1910er Gemälde des berühmten Post-Impressionisten, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die den Wundern der Landschaft staunt, die sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus persönliche Träume und Ziele als Künstler. Seit er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber, und stellte fest, dass er vor einer schwierigen inneren Zwickmühle stand, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. \"Der Traum\" ist Rousseaus Werk, das am besten seine jahrelange innere Schlacht widerspiegelt: sich entweder an bestimmte Malstile anzupassen oder sie nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so sehr verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder seine kreative Unabhängigkeit und Einzigartigkeit zu wahren und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man Rousseaus Lebensgeschichte kennen. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Töpfer und Metallwarenhändler, der \"bürgerlichen Wohlstand\" genoss (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, also Mitarbeiter des städtischen Gebührenkontors, obwohl er den Spitznamen \"douanier\", also Zollbeamter, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, gefolgt vom Tod von acht Kindertoten, ließ Rousseau nur eine Tochter namens Julia und immense Trauer zurück (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und widmete sich der Malerei, um ihm Trost und frischen Beginn zu bieten. Anders als seine zeitgenössischen Kollegen, die den peasants in der Malerei sentimentalisieren und romantisieren, ist Rousseau im Wesentlichen ein Volkskünstler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Fixierung darauf, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist im Kontext verständlich: wie bereits erwähnt, war er ungebildet im Bereich der formalen Malerei und begann seine Karriere in einem viel späteren Alter als viele andere talentierte und besser bekannte moderne Künstler. Obwohl er bereits viele Jahre gearbeitet hatte, erhielt Rousseau keine richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst, bis etwa zur gleichen Zeit, als Matisse begann, sich als Künstler einen Namen zu machen. Im Buch \"Modern French Painters\" behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden nicht nur in Bezug auf Stil und Thema, sondern auch auf die Ursprünge ihres Malens unterschiedlich sind: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf eine banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch darin bestand, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er bei den Artiste Français aufgenommen würde\" (92).",
            "Viele bedeutende Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer fundamentalen Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seinem Gedicht \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" sagt: \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles, was man auf Erden weiß und alles, was man wissen muss.\" Vieles, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht über Bildung oder Erfahrung. Allerdings scheinen wir Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, wie Keats andeutet, ohne in diesen erwarteten Weisen unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind Versuche, zu beschreiben, nicht zu verschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind in der Regel Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literatur schöner ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, nicht eine Reihe von Regeln zur Beurteilung oder Erschaffung guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens. Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann die Essenz des Guten oder Schönen nie vollständig einfangen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von da Vincis Mona Lisa zum Beispiel könnte sich um Begriffe wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Stattdessen ist es üblich, wenn man nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder einer Lieblingsliteratur gefragt wird, eine Phrase wie \"Es gibt einfach etwas daran\" zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Qualitäten reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das nicht auf andere Weise gesagt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Erklärung unzureichend wäre.\" Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt immer etwas Transzendentales. Ich glaube, dass Ethik dieselbe Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: \"Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses 'etwas', diese \"je ne sais quoi\", ist, was den mächtigsten Aspekt von Kunst und Moral ausmacht, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet. Ich glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir sie beide am mächtigsten auf einer noemalen Ebene, im Kant'schen Sinne, erleben. Sie wirken auf einer Ebene, die erlebt werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: \"Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was sie tatsächlich einzigartig macht, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es könnte sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste, wie Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen so relevant für die Literatur wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte. ... Literatur ist uns wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir suchen.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany, as we now know it, comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.). Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premises. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "I stared down, mind blankly comprehending the view before me. Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared. So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at.\nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study. Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.\nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.\nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind's will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenager behind the wheel: the statistics are alarming. Several factors combine to create this deadly trend for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem is that the teenager's brain is not yet ready for the dangers of driving. Inexperience also plays a significant role. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also fare worse when they drive with their peers, which, as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows, happens regularly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that revealed the following correlation: the older the passenger, the fewer traffic accidents occur.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to increase teen driver safety by implementing temporary provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, in my view, these provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The root problem is that, as a group, the youngest drivers, by all statistical measures, are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research has shown that young people under 19-20 frequently engage in risky behavior for the thrill. It makes sense, therefore, to delay driving at least until this tendency has subsided. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we will not only see more deadly accidents but the death toll could skyrocket in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue could be quite straightforward. Schools could continue to teach driver's education to begin the learning process, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, and a certain number of practical driver's training hours would still be required. The specific number of hours could be based on the majority of states' requirements (in California, for example, this is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the deadly statistics for teen drivers are not confined to one state, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and, I believe, effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not a new idea.",
            "In den späten 1890er und frühen 1900er Jahren gab es in der Library of Congress eine Sammlung von frühen Filmen von Edison, insgesamt 15 Filme aus den Jahren 1895 bis 1901. Diese Filme nutzen oft kreative Schnitte, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudien konzentrierten sich darauf, die ästhetischen Merkmale der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionsbiographischen Merkmale in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Trickfilme zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts sind im Allgemeinen in einer festen Kulisse, innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums, gedreht und haben keine Kamerabewegungen, verwenden lange und mittlere Einstellungen und befolgen die strenge Regel, dass ein Schuss gleich einem Film entspricht.\n\nAllerdings gibt es einige Filme am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Regeln brechen, indem sie mehrere Einstellungen einführen. Ein gemeinsames Merkmal, das alle Trickfilme aufweisen, ist, dass sie in einer Innenkulisse innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums gedreht werden. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Proszeniumposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und geht auf das Theater und im speziellen Fall auf Varietéshows und Zauberkunststücke zurück. Eine Einschränkung der Verwendung einer Bühne ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen in der Regel nur von links nach rechts und vice versa wandern und nicht zur Kamera hin oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich hin und her entlang der Horizontalachse. Auch wenn sie den Bildausschnitt verlassen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDie frontale Proszeniumkomposition bedeutet auch, dass die Einstellungen oft lang und seltener mittel sind. Nahaufnahmen gibt es in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog. Dies folgt der Theater- und Varietétradition, in der das Publikum die gesamte Vorstellung zur selben Zeit sieht, die durch die Grenzen der Bühne gerahmt ist. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler auch nicht aus dem Mittelfeld zur Kamera hin, sodass Nahaufnahmen nicht vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Schuss gleich einem Film ist. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von der Anzahl der Bilder pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Varietétats wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschtricks mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Schuss für den Betrachter nicht immer einem physischen Schuss entspricht. Ein einzelner \"Schuss\" kann tatsächlich mehrere sein, die zusammengefügt werden, um den Eindruck von Apperenz oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich genau \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), einen der frühen Trickfilme, an. Eine genauere Untersuchung zeigt den Zeitpunkt, an dem der physische Schuss mit dem abgetrennten \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film für den Betrachter konzeptionell ein einziger Schuss ist.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent proponent of Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, his profession along with his brief political career made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the basis for almost all of his views on government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government. He strongly believed in the natural rights of man and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was man's motivation in all things, but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was somewhat disheartening and the reason for this decline is not entirely clear. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is a noticeable drop in people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which might account for some part of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might have simply slipped off the radar for many people. Additionally, December brings the start of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, and this might also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, none of this really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also speculate that any project of this nature is likely to experience an initial burst of energy and excitement that then naturally declines. In an attempt to fight this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to try and revitalize the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we faced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement and the specific problem of holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to offer incentives for alternative modes of commuting. We offered many prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to counteract that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes did not change significantly during the course of the project. If the prizes had increased in value over time, this might have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start of the project, but announcing a couple of bicycles in December and then a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than decreasing it.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist. For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\nIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dreamland ist eines von Edgar Allan Poes selbst als besser empfundenen Gedichten. In \"Dream-Land\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in Versen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil nutzte diesen Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als das Ende der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil diesen Begriff verwendet hat, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der etwas Anerkennung zusteht. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert.\n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil er Poes Vertrautheit mit den Schriften Goethes zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poe’s Politian und Goethe’s Mignon\", deutet die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitiert haben könnte.\n\nDas Oxford Companion to English Literature beschreibt Goethe als einen berühmten Schriftsteller der lyrischen Dramen,\"Faust\", die in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurden, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr des Todes Goethes, 1832. Im lyrischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Fausts liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thule\". Es handelt sich um einen König, der nach dem Tod seiner Frau, die ihm ein Kelch geschenkt hat, zu trinken beginnt und weint. Er entscheidet dann, dass es an der Zeit ist zu sterben und gibt seine Besitztümer seinen Kindern, behält aber den Kelch. Er geht zu einem Felsen, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Verhalten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich und könnten eine dunkle Kopie von Poes Verlust und seiner Abhängigkeit vom Trinken sein. Faust wurde auch von H.P. Grattan in 1842 in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" lag.\n\nPoe bezieht sich zweimal auf Thule in seinen gesammelten Schriften. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" verwendet er den Begriff \"ultma Thule\", aber er nutzt diesen Ausdruck auch in \"Dream-Land\" als Rahmen des Gedichts. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Dream-Land\" können als companion pieces gelesen werden. Im \"Dream-Land\" beschreibt der Sprecher die Landschaft von Thule als dunkel und einsam, er wird von toten Freunden verfolgt und sieht eine farblose Welt. All diese Szenen könnten in \"Der König von Thule\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat und sich einsam fühlt und seine Willenskraft verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht beschreibt, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre.\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Schriftsteller, den Poe sicherlich gekannt haben musste, allein schon aus Respekt für Tennyson. Als Poe nach seiner Meinung zu Tennyson gefragt wurde, sagte er, dass er ihn neben der Verbindung zu Tennyson auch durch die vielen Nachdrucke, die nach der ersten Veröffentlichung stattfanden, mit Goethes Werken vertraut gemacht wurde.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to clean it up for half an hour because he was having dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim summarily. To claim punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple customers were injured from slipping in the months before her accident, and despite this knowledge, he failed to clean up the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less persuasive but reasonable considering the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the same day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a partial summary motion against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally witnessed the media in America shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam. I don’t think that in 2001 we could have imagined a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who had a clear Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet intrigues me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, it contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From my past knowledge and learning, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a sort of martyr, who was misinterpreted and even humbled himself before others. After which, one by one, people began to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the authors intended Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet, who did not need to prove anything but lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is as if they are trying to steal credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, there are many stories in the biography that seem to serve as proof of ‘witness’ or how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam. However, the problem is that many of these stories are from a third-party perspective. The author illustrates that he heard these stories from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so, and so on. I did not like this approach because, although their intention was to provide proof of the truth of the stories, it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try to exalt and elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think that Muslims today might not know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today's world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the original intent of the religion's namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire. But later, that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus' lifetime?\nIf we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle illustrates how humans deep down are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only look out for themselves and want to make their lives as good as possible, but they never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The book shows this in many ways. The most obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They don't care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their progress. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They don't care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also didn't care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Manche Autoren verwenden verschiedene Methoden, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine bestimmte Einstellung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind wirksamer als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald nutzt viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman \"Der große Gatsby\". Manchmal paart er ein Adjektiv und ein Nomen, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und nutzt es dann zu diesem Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In \"Der große Gatsby\" baut Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere für Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet diese Bedeutungen später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl gegenüber einem wichtigen Objekt zu vermitteln.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und nutzt, ist Uniformität, wobei Weiß etwas freundlicher und höherwertiger ist und Grau älter und verflogen. Fitzgerald etabliert diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans durch die wiederholte Verwendung beider Farben. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - in der Tat tragen alle immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellhosen\" (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\" (36), wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"pulverweiß\" (30) gepudert. In Wirklichkeit tragen Menschen nur dann etwas anderes als Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party beschreibt: \"die Korridore... sind bunt mit Primärfarben\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter durch die Farbgebung vieler alltäglicher, unwichtiger Dinge: Als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Abgründe der unteren New York\" (56) hinab, die Namen der Menschen bei Gatsbys Partys sind nun \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, und die Wohnung von Catherine ist \"eine Scheibe in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Appartement-Häusern\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch alltägliche oder unwichtige Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Mädchenzeit\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Länder\" (23) im Tal der Asche, das \"italienische Kind\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26), und der Hundebezügler ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27). Nachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, nutzt er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Uniformität gegenüber bestimmten Themen zu vermitteln. Dies beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne eine signifikante Verwendung von entweder von diesen Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in Weiß\" (74) gekleidet in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\" ; die Leser fangen an, Daisy als weniger als eine Figur, sondern mehr wie eine uniforme Ergänzung zu sehen, etwas, das Gatsby will und nach dem er strebt. Fitzgerald verwendet diese Technik weiter um Daisy herum, um den Eindruck zu verstärken, dass Daisy mehr eine uniforme Ergänzung ist, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Hauch von Daisys Pelzkragen\" (18) und sie trägt wieder ein \"weißes\" (115) Kleid vor dem Treffen mit Tom und Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nA suitable piece of property was selected from a real estate website and available government programs were researched to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Kultur spielt eine wesentliche Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann definiert werden als viel mehr, was sie nicht ist, als das, was sie tatsächlich ist, und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist nicht homogen, noch ist sie eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht einheitlich oder uniform. Aussagen wie “alle Russen sind stur” oder “alle Japaner sind anpassungsfähig” sind in sich selbst gewaltig und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis der allgemeinen Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es für einen Verhandler vielmehr produktiv, die Bedeutung der Kultur im Hinblick auf das Thema und wie die Einstellung der Kultur die Gespräche am Verhandlungstisch beeinflussen kann, zu verstehen. Wenn man eine fremde Kultur trifft, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche sind unvermeidlich.\n\nDas Verständnis einer fremden Kultur oder Mentalität kann alles von der Untersuchung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zum Erkennen ihrer Vorurteile umfassen. Anstatt zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, eine Kultur zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders insbesondere in der Verhandlung, und besonders dann, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch tritt. Ebenso, wenn ein Verhandler sich auf “fremdem” Terrain befindet, kann Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen nur dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass sich Kultur nicht notwendigerweise auf eine nationale/Internationale Zweiteilung beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb einer gegebenen Nation schaffen ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur die Arbeit im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Zeichen einer Unternehmenskultur lassen sich in der Kleidung der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkt vs. indirekt, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungsmethoden erkennen. Einige Unternehmen fördern das Engagement von Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene der Mitarbeiter, während andere es auf “genehmigte” Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen beschränken. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und tatsächlich besteht innerhalb einer Gesellschaft auch innerhalb eines Unternehmens eine große Vielfalt, auch von Region zu Region, einschließlich städtischer und Vorort-Umgebungen) betrachten, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur wohnen können. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht so geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden möglicherweise einheitlicher, aber ein solches Äußeres ist nur ein Zeichen, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind sogar wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den Grundsatz einer Kultur darstellen. Wenn es in einer Kultur darum geht, das Gesicht zu wahren oder Gemeinschaftsharmonie, ist es sicherlich, dass ein Verhandler seinen Arbeitgeber oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich blamieren wird, um am Verhandlungstisch zu triumphieren. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, der ein harter Handeln einen höheren Stellenwert einräumt, nicht unbedingt dazu gedrängt sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einem Abschluss zu kommen. Diese allgemeinen Erkenntnisse sollten berücksichtigt werden, bevor man sich an den Verhandlungstisch begibt. Allerdings ist ein Verhandler gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effizient zu gestalten.",
            "Der Narr sprach in seinem Herzen: „Es gibt keinen Gott.“ Diese Aussage findet sich erstmals in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und erscheint als Einführung in die Argumentation von St. Anselm über das Dasein Gottes. Es scheint, dass auch der andere Autor, den wir diskutieren werden, Thomas Aquinas, diese Überzeugung teilt. Da beide ihre Argumente in der Verteidigung desselben Konzeptes ausführen und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu entscheiden, welches der beiden besser ist, müssen wir, um der Kürze willen, davon ausgehen, dass beide in der Existenz Gottes, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen. Die Annahme eines Gottes, der nicht dem einer ähnlichen Vorstellung entspricht, würde einen adäquaten Vergleich ihrer beiden Argumente nicht zulassen, da sie im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung einer bestimmten Gottesvorstellung beitragen. Es ist zu vermuten, dass beide jeweils wertvolle Punkte ansprechen, aber keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\n\nUm dies zu veranschaulichen, untersucht man zunächst die Grundidee von St. Anselm. Anselms Passage reflektiert einen Weg zur Erkenntnis durch den Glauben und den Blick in das eigene Innere, um Beweise für Gottes Existenz zu finden. Er erklärt, dass, weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, wir ihn nicht effektiv als nichtexistent denken können. Während diese Idee in seiner Terminologie etwas schwerfällig und manchmal unklar ist, besteht das grundlegende Konzept darin, dass die Beweisführung für Gott innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes liegt. St. Anselm schlägt vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz eines solchen Wesens nur durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir als wahr wissen, in unseren eigenen Geistern gefunden wird. Fremde Beweise sind angeblich nicht notwendig. Diese Idee, die Annahme dessen, für das es keine unumstößliche empirische Evidenz gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee steht im Gegensatz zu der von St. Thomas Aquinas vertretenen. Thomas stattet die Existenz Gottes durch pure Vernunft und empirische Beweise aus, ohne dass der Glaube eine Rolle spielt. Eine solche Idee wäre vorteilhaft für die Missionierung, einem wichtigen Aspekt des Christentums, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Convertiten ermöglichen würde, ohne von deren Bereitschaft abhängig zu sein, etwas Unbewiesenes anzunehmen. Stattdessen könnten sie durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas führt fünf verschiedene logische Argumente zur Unterstützung der Gottesexistenz vor: Veränderung, Ursache, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem Fall zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn dir erklärt wird, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du die anderen Teile zusammensetzt, so zwingt dich die Logik, die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Puzzleteils zu kennen, ohne es sehen zu müssen.",
            "Einmal im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages als Buddha bekannt sein würde. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er die Welt auf und erlangte die Erleuchtung, und seine Lehren führten zur Gründung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Dies ist in vielen Bereichen ersichtlich, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasserritual gefeiert wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen daran teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gesprochen hat. Diese Unterschiede erstrecken sich von oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zu den soteriologischen Grundlagen der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinde, sowohl aus der monastischen Perspektive als auch aus der der Laien, hat im Laufe der Zeit ihre doctrinalen Prinzipien ändern müssen. Dies ist sowohl auf äußere als auch auf innere Einflüsse, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende zurückzuführen.\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Begriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Dazu gehört der Begriff von inneren versus äußeren Kräften. Hier wird eine innere Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasana stammt, unabhängig von deren monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder ihr schaden will – eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft nicht schaden will, die jedoch möglicherweise doch schaden kann oder auch hilft – sei es als Nebenwirkung. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet.\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Zentrum des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Dreifachjuwel des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den drei Körben – dem Tripitaka – der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Sutras, der Vinaya Pitaka die disziplinären Regeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Konzepte umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – das inhärente Leiden im Leben und Anicca – die Unbeständigkeit alles. Erst durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der unablässig ist. Mit dem Ende von Sansara endet auch Lobha – Begierde, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Verblendung, wenn man erleuchtet ist. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden die Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde nicht unkeusch sein und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinäre Regeln zu befolgen. Die fundamentale doctrinale Idee im Buddhismus ist die Lehre der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that at one time were burdened by a long-lasting rivalry that endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The height of this rivalry was marked by the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, and these tensions gradually subsided just before the First World War. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as major conflicts of material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is not uncommon for neighboring nations, which often have conflicting interests that lead to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are not unique in this regard. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American nations have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues have created a rift between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similarly, the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests considered vital by each nation. In this case, however, the ideological disputes were rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust was inherited from the distrust between the English and Spanish. These feelings of distrust, carried over from their colonial rulers, posed a significant obstacle to the establishment of friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. The majority of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a major issue that persisted until both the United States and Mexico enforced military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security that I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a little of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, here I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call my own. I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D’Arcy Thompson stated that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Since 2012, Indonesia has seen little change in neonatal and infant mortality rates. Despite progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health have fallen short of the 2015 goals. We will explore the reasons for this below, pointing to a need to bolster the health system rather than focus on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has increased the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers to 72%, but this still includes traditional birth attendants like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions for complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. Improvements in this area are misleading, and there's still much to do. Additionally, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrhea by healthcare professionals has decreased.\n\nData on postnatal care is incomplete, but it's clear that this area is also problematic with low rates nationwide. C-section rates are still low, at around 4%, with urban areas seeing 7% and rural areas 2%. This highlights equity issues, as access to healthcare services is primarily in urban areas. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access care due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen planning next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or strengthen the overall health system? Programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable objectives and quicker results. However, they can lead to funding shortages and human resource imbalances, with programs attracting more resources. Additionally, parallel programs for one area can result in service duplication and uncoordinated efforts, leading to increased paperwork and bureaucracy.",
            "Victorian Romane zeichnen sich durch ihre ausführliche Detailgenauigkeit und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der damaligen Zeit aus. Zwei Romane, die von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Werke nutzen ein Element des Mystery und eine Vorliebe für das Absonderliche, was für die damaligen Romane untypisch ist und die Charaktere in jedem Werk stärken; sie bieten Einblicke in ihre Motive und Emotionen.\n\n“Und nun drängten sich unzählige verwirrende und verwirrende Ideen in seinen Geist. Es schien, als ob er noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit ginge, die sich wütend stritten; denn die Worte, die sie sagten, hallten in seinen Ohren wider; und als er seine Aufmerksamkeit wieder auf sich selbst lenkte, … fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich zuckte er zusammen, als er den Schuss hörte; und aus der Luft erhoben sich laute Schreie und Rufe; Lichter blitzten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Chaos, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilig fortschleppte. Durch all diese raschen Visionen zog ein unbestimmtes, unruhiges Bewusstsein für den Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich quälte.\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen diese Mystery oft durch Träume oder träumerische Zustände, wobei der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variiert. In Oliver Twist offenbaren diese eigenartigen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn quält und seine Erkenntnisse über die wahre Natur der um ihn herum geschehenen Dinge. Als die Schießerei in Kapitel 28 wieder aufgerufen wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft, als ob er träumte, während er verzweifelt nach Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont Olivers fehlende Kontrolle über die Ereignisse, die sich abspielten, sowie die bedenkliche Lage seiner Gesundheit, die durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit stark präsent ist. Die Schießerei überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, er bemerkt die “unsichtbare Hand” nicht, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seinen Schmerz wieder, entfernt von der Überraschung des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun ständig und mit Angst verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück verursachte, da es sicher nicht sein eigenes war. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver über nichts Kontrolle hat, und kann sich nicht einmal bemühen, die Kontrolle über das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu erlangen, nicht einmal, wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch durch diesen Abschnitt angedeutet, als ob alter Fagin ihn brechen würde, indem er ihn dazu bringt, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren, was seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, beeinflusst. Andernfalls könnte man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest einen Versuch unternommen hätte, zumindest um seines eigenen Lebens willen.\n\nDer Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war gekommen und gegangen, so schnell wie der nächste kam; und die Nacht brach wieder herein; eine lange, lange Nacht und doch so kurz; lang in ihrer schrecklichen Stille und kurz in ihrem fluchtartigen Vergehen.” (Dickens, 220)",
            "Ein paar Jahre ago, arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, bei dem ich Elementarschüler unterrichtete. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in ihren jeweiligen Fächern zu helfen, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englisch- und Lesenunterricht. Eine der Lehrerinnen rekrutierte mich, um einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen, der große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen hatte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse). Es wurde mir schnell klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere nicht einmal annähernd. Du weißt, er war Lateinamerikaner und sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir kämpften uns weiter, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich war gerade dabei, ein paar Kinder zu betreuen, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr geringen Spanischkenntnissen (ich hatte gerade erst angefangen, es zu lernen) kamen wir irgendwie miteinander aus. Es war dann, als mir der Groschen fiel: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur die englischen Buchstaben nicht richtig. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Einsicht ihm wirklich viel half, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser dran ist.\n\nDiese Geschichte erzähle ich, um auf das Problem des Sprachbarrieren in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, aufmerksam zu machen. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, alle können zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also: Was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Nachhilfe im Englischlesen, besonders im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Die duale Sprachsystem, der Mainstreamansatz, private Nachhilfe, ESL-Klassen – keine dieser Methoden, für sich allein, wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, alle diese Ansätze zu kombinieren!\n\nZuerst einmal ist das duale Sprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungseinrichtungen haben sich akademisch besser entwickelt als ihre Mitschüler“, heißt es. Es gibt viele Ängste, dass dies eine Ressourceverschwendung sei und dass die meisten Kinder in den Schulen keine Vorteile davon hätten. Aber das ist nicht wahr. Wenn wir solche Programme in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, statt als Ausnahme, anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir vor? Müssen wir alle Lehrer bilingual sein? Nein, das wäre unrealistisch und unvernünftig. Aber ich denke, es gibt keinen Grund, warum wir nicht spezialisierte Helfer, Tutor*innen oder wie man sie auch nennen möchte, haben könnten, die bilingual sind.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too. He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define. What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have begun to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as:\n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",
            "Die Lieferkettenverwaltung ist der Fluss von Prozessen, die die Waren von der Kundenbestellung über die Rohstoffphase, Versorgung, Produktion und Verteilung von Produkten an den Kunden bringt. Der Begriff \"Supply Chain Management\" wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Umsetzung und Steuerung dessen, was auf der Lieferkette passiert, um Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu befriedigen. Es gibt sechs wesentliche Elemente in einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsmanager nutzen diese sechs wesentlichen Elemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Sie bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles hergestellt wird. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Um dies zu erfahren, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator dafür, was die Kunden nachfragen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und in welcher Menge. Nach der Entscheidung, was produziert und in welcher Menge hergestellt werden soll, sind die Manager bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welche Fabrik am besten für die Volumen- und Qualitätsanforderungen geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenbedürfnisse und -zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen. Sobald der Produktionsort festgelegt ist, konzentrieren sich die Manager auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Wartung der Geräte. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist entscheidend im gesamten Prozess. Wenn jedes Detail nicht ordnungsgemäß geplant wird, kann dies dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben für jede Geschäftseinheit ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess. Es gibt eine vorgegebene Anordnung, wie eine Mitarbeiteruniform aussehen soll, bis hin zum Empfang von LKW-Lieferungen. Diese festgelegten Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über die Richtung und Erwartungen.",
            "Hitler lives in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard high above her head. The unsettling message is written on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, there were several street protests, the first public protests in a decade. Led by many Burmese monks, these protests were known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial unrest, the public became more involved, and while the government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, violence escalated into what some considered a full-scale war between the monks and the military junta. The military attacked and looted monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, said, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. Governments' desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over their citizens has existed since the dawn of civilization. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to rule every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to be gods sent to lead their people to prosperity through inventions like Motorola cell phones and seppuku. Our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nWell-known examples of these actions include the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the authoritarian government. The death toll varies widely, with official Chinese government reports stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s is another example, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich,' a period spanning several years and countries where people of Jewish background were rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellingtons Vermächtnis im Jazz resultiert weitgehend aus seiner Langlebigkeit und seinen kreativen Fähigkeiten, die sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, doch als Komponist war er herausragend dabei, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder in den Vordergrund stellen. Er hat den Rahmen geschaffen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, und gleichzeitig eng orchestrierte Stücke und Phrasen geschrieben, die auf den speziellen Stil der Bandmitglieder verwiesen, um musikalische Ideen zu unterstreichen. Auf diese Weise hat er auch den Klang des Orchesters insgesamt betont und originale, zusammenhängende Klänge für jedes Stück geschaffen. Ellingtons Meisterschaft über die individuellen Klänge der Spieler sowie deren Zusammenwirken in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Lexikon beschreibt in Bezug auf Ellingtons Klang und Innovation die \"Creole Love Call\" als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme als \"Jazz-Instrument\" in seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Fähigkeit, die Stimme einzusetzen, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne den Lyrikschranken zu unterliegen. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere hindurch zeigen lässt. Dieses langsame, gezielte bluesige Zwölftaktstück besteht aus sechs Chorussen, wie folgt:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und gegen Ende rauer wird.\n\nChorus 2: Muted Trumpet Solo, das die Grundmelodie ausführt und mehrere verlängerte Bluesnoten betont.\n\nChorus 3: Weitreichender Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, begleitet von einer subtilen synkopierten Klavierphrase.\n\nChorus 4: Volles Orchester wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call and response durch die Blech- und Holzbläserabteilungen.\n\nChorus 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stücks, bei dem die Holzbläser den Call and response in einem hohen Register beginnen, begleitet von synkopiertem Stop-Time von den Blech- und Rhythmusabteilungen.\n\nChorus 6: Zurück zur Struktur des ersten Choruses mit Call and response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus nimmt die Stimme den \"Growl\"-Klang an und spielt wie ein Instrument solo.\n\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einer Vocalrun und einem unkonventionellen dissonanten Trompetensolo-Ende.\n\nEllingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine zusätzliche Dimension von Tonfarbe zu verleihen, ist ein Beispiel für eine stilistische Eigenart, die sich durch seine gesamte Werkstatt durchzieht. In \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeiten in der engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für die Tonfarbe. Ein Call and response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley am muted Trumpet und Baby Cox' Scat-Singen nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley's Spiel und instrumentale Aspekte von Cox' Stimme, um einen reichen und ergänzenden Klang zu schaffen. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" führt diese Ideen weiter, indem Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine ständige Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf muted Trompete einzuführen.",
            "She had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat), and fish, while also featuring lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have reported an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies, however, did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified accordingly. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America experienced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most influential corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must ask the following questions: how did this crisis come about, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to grant sub-prime loans to an already immature and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves with inadequate capital reserves and transferred the resulting chaos to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and ultimately to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President was seeking a second term in office. To achieve this goal, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would follow seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMany factors combined to plunge the economy into chaos, one of which was the new and complex mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general becoming overleveraged in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",

Oder der Teil, bei dem deine Leser einschlafen und/oder auf \"Zurück\" klicken, während sie deinen Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, dass sie an ihrem Monitor schreit, wenn sie sich in der Mitte von Too Much Information wiederfindet, und das nicht auf die gute Weise.\n\nDie Einführung ist dein Feind.\n\nDeine lieben Leser kennen bereits die grundlegende Schreibregel \"Show, don't tell\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch über lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert, oder noch schlimmer, zu viel. Die Einführung ist der kleine Teufel auf deiner Schulter, der dir sagt, dass du die Geschichte aus dem Weg schaffen sollst, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der dich dazu drängt, deinem Publikum jede Einzelheit aus den Kindertagen jedes Charakters zu erzählen).\n\nDie Einführung bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Sprache. Im Film findet die Einführung statt, wenn eine Figur der anderen eine Informationsspritze verpasst, wie in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". In der Fiktion tut das der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist hier angebracht. Wenn du eine Geschichte liest und erfährst, dass die Heldin ihren geliebten Partner an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie in einer prunkvollen Weise geheiratet haben und dass ihr Mann ihr vor den Augen getötet wurde, würdest du nicht erwarten, dass diese entire Sequenz zwei Seiten in Anspruch nimmt, während beide nur zwei Zeilen haben. Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor Zeit in die Charakterentwicklung des Ehemanns investiert, indem er durch seine Sprache und seinen Stil zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest ebenfalls erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Gesten zeigt, wie sehr das Vorhandensein ihres Lebens in ihrem Leben zu Veränderungen und Bereicherung geführt hat (vor allem, wenn die Geschichte dir später direkt erzählt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine angemessene Einführung in den Ehemann würde dir ermöglichen, emotional in sein Schicksal involviert zu sein und Einblicke in die Charaktere der Heldin zu gewinnen: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, reflektiert durch den Spiegel seiner Augen, und so weiter. Du würdest seinen Tod mit ihr trauern und dich so enger mit der Heldin selbst verbinden.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass du dem simplem Knochen der Handlung Fleisch hinzufügst: \"Sie trafen sich, heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller musst du das Fleisch liefern. (*schaut auf das Metaphern, seufzt, setzt seinen Weg fort*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, bestimmte Dinge zu übergehen. Vielleicht führst du einen neuen Charakter ein und weißt, dass er früher in der Air Force war, jetzt Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zwei Mal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, am Wochenende gerne fischen geht, im Geheimen davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und am Morgen Eier Benedict hatte.",
            "Ich habe zwei Nachrichtenberichte aus Columbus, Ohio gesehen. Der erste Bericht, der live war, kam von NBC 4 heute Morgen (August 13, 2011). Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name war Shad Hostettler, und es wurde kein Name der Frau genannt. Sie zeigten sein Foto und er sah aus wie der pure Böse. Sie widmeten diesem Bericht etwa zwei Minuten, da die Entwicklung noch im Gange war. Die einzigen Details, die sie gaben, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und verhaftet worden war. Ich denke, sie haben diesem Bericht eine angemessene Zeit gewidmet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem frühen Morgen-Schuss auf Travis Buyers, 18 Jahre alt. Er wurde in der Sharon Woods Area angeschossen und war in kritischem Zustand; es gab zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team untersuchte den Vorfall. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das könnte daran gelegen haben, dass es sich um einen \"schwarzen\" Mann oder eine \"schwarze\" Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe (und das schon seit Jahren) bemerkt, dass Minderheiten bei einem Verbrechen oft übersehen werden. Wenn zum Beispiel ein \"weißes\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder ein Opfer eines Verbrechens ist, wird die Medienwelt verrückt; aber wenn es sich um eine Minderheit handelt, ist es froh, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Einschussloch, das in einem Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden wurde. Details dazu, wo der Vorfall passiert sein könnte, wurden gegeben. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr gehandelt hatte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten für Hinweise, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen, eine Belohnung von 5.000 Dollar an.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Einbruch in einen UDF an Clime Road in Columbus. Es wurde gesagt, dass es sich um einen Mann mit dunkler Hautfarbe handelte, der den Laden überfallen hatte. Er trug einen Hoodie-Sweatshirt und war etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wog etwa 68 Kilogramm. Ich fand es ungewöhnlich, dass sie so viel Zeit damit verbrachten, zu betonen, dass er schwarz ist und wie dunkel er ist.\n\nEin weiterer Bericht handelte von einem Rene Rodriguez, der als texanischer Drogenboss verhaftet worden war. Er war wegen des Versuchs, Marihuana in großen Mengen von Texas nach Ohio zu verteilen, verurteilt worden. Ein merkwürdiger Punkt, den ich bemerkte, war, dass sie anstatt zu sagen, dass er 25 Jahre Gefängnis bekommen hatte, sagten \"300\" Monate. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was dahintersteckte, ob sie dachten, das klang härter oder was. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann war, ich denke, das war nicht wirklich relevant für die Geschichte.",
            "Es gibt eine tiefe Verbindung zwischen Brüdern; eine unauflösliche, unaufhebbares Band. In dieser Verbindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen sich, weit mehr als jemand anderes mit einer solchen Verbindung, und sie sehen sich selbst nur in ihrem Bruder. Es ist in den scheinbar aussichtslosesten Situationen, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Gefühle sich zeigen, tragen sie eine hohe Kosten. Ein Teil des Verstehens der Gefühle, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung entstehen, besteht darin, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn jemand seinem Bruder in die Augen sieht, erkennt er sich selbst darin nicht so, wie andere ihn sehen, sondern so, wie er wirklich ist. In seinen Taten und den Konsequenzen dieser Taten liegt seine wahre Charakter. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die wilden Emotionen, die damit verbunden sind. Durch eine üppige, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft setzen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert mit intensiver Stolz in der entscheidenden Szene, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihren Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Sicht des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum kommuniziert, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen einwirken.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf eine einzige Gefühl zurückführen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, das erste Mal zusammen unterwegs sind, bis zu ihrer letzten, tragischen Expedition, empfindet der Protagonist Ressentiment gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, den er alle seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten lehren könnte, wie \"… Luft anzuhalten, laufen, springen oder auf den Ranken im Old Woman Swamp klettern…\". Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle eines \"…jemandem zu dem man bis Horsehead Landing rennt…und jemandem, mit dem man auf der oberen Gabelung des großen Pins hinter dem Scheune sitzt…\" einnehmen könnte. Offensichtlich sind solche Dinge unmöglich, da Doodle mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren wurde, was seine Überlebenschancen stark mindert. Und selbst wenn es fast unmöglich wäre, dass er je anstrengende körperliche Aktivitäten ausübt. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilden Fantasien ist, dass all diese Träume so schnell zerschlagen werden. Tatsächlich wird gezeigt, dass er sogar eine gewisse Wut auf das kleine Kind hat, als er daran denkt, ihn durch Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu töten. Welcher Kind hätte die Geistesgegenwart, um Infanticide in Betracht zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so simple Handlung kann dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung geben! Das zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark ist. In seinem Hinterkopf hat er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.",
            "The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind as you learn about the brain that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions. Information processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple information like color, orientation, and object borders, where color changes significantly over a short space, to recognize it as a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made at some steps in the bottom-up process to speed up recognition. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background. Once information has been processed to a certain degree, an attention filter determines its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For instance, even though your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name even if spoken in a noisy room. There are many processing stages, and processing results are modulated by attention repeatedly. For the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded, with different encoding types for each sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons for a short period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins. There are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are concept nodes and that these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley kritisiert in \"Brave New World\" die aufkommende Bedrohung durch Technologie und die kapitalistische Struktur, die diese stärkt, indem sie eine dystopische Gesellschaft schafft. In dieser Gesellschaft wird Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen gestellt, und die Menschen werden von Anfang an so konditioniert, dass sie das Streben nach sofortiger Glückseligkeit über alles andere stellen. Die Bürger werden als Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die in einer Ideologie leben, die vom World Controller vorgegeben wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes mit marxistischen Augenwinkeln wird die heimliche Skepsis des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung dieser Systeme deutlich. Begriffe wie Homogenität und Reifikation aus der Marxismus unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Fehlern der aufstrebenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch die Marxistische These der falschen Bewusstsein kritisiert. Die Normalbürger werden daran gehindert, die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen zu erkennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihrem eigenen Vorteil interessiert sind. Dies ist das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle der Proletarier und der einfachen Arbeiter, was in der Conditionierung der Menschen im Brave New World deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, wie Delta und Gamma, haben keinen wahren eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Antrieb zu Konsum, Ausgeben und Indulgen gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass soziale Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen total dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall deutlich. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst, sie \"kaufen\" quasi eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (also Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Möglichkeit geboren, dies zu erkennen, tun aber nichts; selbst Alphas oder Betas wie Bernard tun wenig mehr, als ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie weiter ausgeführt wird, bedeutsame Indikationen der wahrgenommenen Kapitalismusoppression.\n\nIn Brave New World gibt es keine Beziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen. Der Roman scheint sich weigern, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden; selbst bei den Hauptfiguren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley damit sagen, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen dem Menschen die Freiheit und Ausdrucksmöglichkeit nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme irgendeines Gefühls; Interaktionen bleiben oberflächlich, dargestellt durch die Kommentare der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf deren körperliche Attraktivität beziehen, und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen. Zudem zeigt die allgemeine Zufriedenheit der gesellschaftlichen Schichten mit ihrem Platz im Hierarchie den sozioökonomischen Einfluss des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Unterordnung in der Gemeinschaft zeigt den Marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat wider, das sich selbst einen falschen Überlegenheitsgefühl geben lässt, solange es weiter konsumiert, sich unterordnet und in der Spur der Gleichaltrigen bleibt.",
            "Ich habe in diesem Semester etwa zwei Jahre und vierzehn Monate studiert, das sind auch vier und ein halbes Semester. Für viele, einschließlich mir, ist es schwierig, sich auf dem Campus zu bewegen. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls Wohnheim untergebracht; das ist im Wesentlichen der östlichste Punkt des Campus, ausgenommen das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center. Der Weg von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu meinen Vorlesungen in so weit entfernten Gebäuden wie dem Willard Building, das sich in der Mitte des Campus befindet, konnte bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders bei schlechter Witterung, wie sie häufig in State College vorkommt. Ein Absolvent, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erzählte mir, dass die East Halls Wohnheime nicht lange her von einem großen ungenutzten Landstück getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportplätzen, neuen Gebäuden wie dem neuen Creamery und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstgebäude gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Während unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es schwieriger und schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Welche ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Ein Fahrrad allein wird jedoch keine Probleme lösen. Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch unterhielt mich mit einem Freund, der erst kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder mit dem Fahrradfahren angefangen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragt, warum er jemals aufgehört hat. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „ein paar Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben der Tatsache, dass es gut für den Körper ist, ist Radfahren die effizienteste Art zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung können dich 30 Meilen oder mehr bringen. Wie viele andere Erstsemester lebe auch ich abseits des Campus, genau so weit weg von der Campusmitte wie einige Wohnheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Vorlesungen im Thomas Building, das etwa 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit einem Fahrrad kann man diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn man schnell pedalt. Das Problem ist nur, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas Building von meinem Haus aus ist, und es ist nicht immer leicht, diese Straße zu befahren, egal ob mit oder ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt auch Vieles zu sagen für das Gehen, aber ich bin zu beschäftigt, um zu gehen. Wenn ich mein Fahrrad nicht hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Möglichkeit, zum Unterricht zu kommen. Ein tägliches Gehen zum Thomas Building würde mir extra 30-40 Minuten meines Tages kosten. Das sind über zwei und ein halbes Stunden pro Woche. Hinzu kommt all die Zeit, die ich für den Weg zu und vom Unterricht, zu Terminen und so weiter aufwenden müsste. Das ist zu viel Zeit, die ich nicht erübrigen kann."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The following paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited, as well as the medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to highlight their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in falling or staying asleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is defined by difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep episodes. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice showed that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that animal models of mice can be generalized to human studies. This indicates that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could affect the ability to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and daily events that involve monotonous tasks and focus.",
            "This paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n(CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that although disguise can be useful for prolonged deception, ultimately one must shed this new identity or risk losing oneself. The challenge of ending a deception is the risk of isolation, as one must decide between self-preservation and maintaining relationships. While some may accept the deception, others will be deeply offended.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises many issues, with the most significant being the motivation. Why does the subject feel the need to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it’s clear it's a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nUpon arriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from the women, cutting her off from a crucial support system. To make matters worse, her convincing portrayal as a man leads Olivia to confuse her with Sebastian and fall in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must deal with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this might seem progressive to a modern reader, Twelfth Night may also illustrate how deception can uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Certain passages suggest they might have unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia secretly harbor feelings for women? One might argue that this is unlikely, as Olivia seems more likely to judge others based solely on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",

Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen Politiken und seiner Herrschaftsform so vielfältig wie in seiner Geografie. Die Bildungseinrichtungen in den Kolonien waren ebenfalls sehr unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 die Herrschaft über Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganyika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Zahl von gebildeten und alphabetisierten Afrikanern vor. Die deutschen Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heutiges Namibia) bot einen starken Kontrast. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen einrichtete und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der Bildung der Eingeborenen in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den Missionarsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete und die Missionars Schools stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese BildungsPolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien über erhebliche Zahlen an alphabetisierten und gebildeten Afrikanern verfügten, blieb die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch. Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu dieser unterschiedlichen Erfahrung in Südwestafrika. Dieser Artikel soll die Diskussion erweitern, indem er diese Faktoren identifiziert und insbesondere auf neue Forschung zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den Eingeborenen eingeht.\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zum Thema Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und stammen aus dem frühen 20. Jahrhundert, entweder während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft. Die frühen Werke hatten hauptsächlich das Ziel, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Werke in englischer Sprache erweiterten die Diskussion durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Die prominenteste Arbeit, die sich explizit mit dem Thema dieses Artikels befasst, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Nach Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung in Südwestafrika viele der unterscheidenden Merkmale des Kolonialsystems.\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen Kolonialbesitzungen Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein gemäßigt gemäßertes Klima, obwohl ein großer Teil des Gebiets von ariden Wüsten bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten etwa 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößeren Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.",
            "Die Einteilung der Populärmusik hat sich in den letzten 100 Jahren so stark weiterentwickelt, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres vollständig aufzulisten. Die Sache wird noch komplizierter durch die Tatsache, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – wie Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen – zahlreiche Unter- und Unteruntergenres innerhalb ihrer Sphäre hervorgebracht haben. Das Untergenre Heavy Metal Rock hat sich in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielseitigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der Populärmusik entwickelt. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es eine breite Palette an Emotionen zeigt, die jedoch oft dunkler Natur sind. Es ist vielseitig, weil die Menschen sehr früh erkannten, dass der Heavy Metal eine große Flexibilität bietet, die sie nutzen konnten, um eigene Unter- und Unteruntergenres zu schaffen, was bis heute weitergeht.\n\nHeute haben wir im Heavy Metal eine so große Vielfalt an Nischengruppen erreicht, dass es schwierig ist, genau zu sagen, was Heavy Metal eigentlich ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres integriert, aber wie alles andere hat es auch Wurzeln. Um die heutige Metal-Musik zu verstehen, muss man erst einmal verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert wird. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehrs“ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivität, mehr Fähigkeiten; die Musiker in Metal-Bands können wirklich gut spielen, und das hört man in der Musik. Metal ist auch, wie es wahrscheinlich kaum überraschend ist, eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen geprägt ist. Es gab in der Mitte der 70er Jahre eine psychedelische Drogenwelle, die die Menschen verrückter machte, was dazu führte, dass sie verrückte, andereweltliche Platinen aufnahmen, wobei die Drogen als Entschuldigung für ihre Schöpfung dienten. Es hat viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, was damals im Musikleben neu war, da eine große Menge an beliebter Musik Qualitäten hatte, die nicht dem dunklen Teil des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Spätere Generationen des Metals haben auch einige Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten, die so in der Romantik Ära vorhanden waren. Lyrics wie die folgenden drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Zeilen aus Helter Skelter zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Es stellt einen Auf und Ab dar, das angeblich von Drogen verursacht wurde. Dieses Lied wird von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy Metal Lieder betrachtet. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Lied der Rolling Stones, das auch schwerer und dunkler war. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer klingen konnten wie die Stones, und so brachten sie dieses Lied auf das Weiße Album.",
            "Einige Jahrzehnte vor den Surrealisten begannen, ihre traumhaften Werke zu malen, war Henri Rousseau damit beschäftigt, seine eigenen Träume, sowohl wörtlich als auch metaphorisch, zu erschaffen. \"Der Traum\", ein 1910er Gemälde des berühmten Post-Impressionisten, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die den Wundern der Landschaft staunt, die sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus persönliche Träume und Ziele als Künstler. Seit er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber, und stellte fest, dass er vor einer schwierigen inneren Zwickmühle stand, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. \"Der Traum\" ist Rousseaus Werk, das am besten seine jahrelange innere Schlacht widerspiegelt: sich entweder an bestimmte Malstile anzupassen oder sie nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so sehr verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder seine kreative Unabhängigkeit und Einzigartigkeit zu wahren und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man Rousseaus Lebensgeschichte kennen. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Töpfer und Metallwarenhändler, der \"bürgerlichen Wohlstand\" genoss (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, also Mitarbeiter des städtischen Gebührenkontors, obwohl er den Spitznamen \"douanier\", also Zollbeamter, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, gefolgt vom Tod von acht Kindertoten, ließ Rousseau nur eine Tochter namens Julia und immense Trauer zurück (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und widmete sich der Malerei, um ihm Trost und frischen Beginn zu bieten. Anders als seine zeitgenössischen Kollegen, die den peasants in der Malerei sentimentalisieren und romantisieren, ist Rousseau im Wesentlichen ein Volkskünstler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Fixierung darauf, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist im Kontext verständlich: wie bereits erwähnt, war er ungebildet im Bereich der formalen Malerei und begann seine Karriere in einem viel späteren Alter als viele andere talentierte und besser bekannte moderne Künstler. Obwohl er bereits viele Jahre gearbeitet hatte, erhielt Rousseau keine richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst, bis etwa zur gleichen Zeit, als Matisse begann, sich als Künstler einen Namen zu machen. Im Buch \"Modern French Painters\" behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden nicht nur in Bezug auf Stil und Thema, sondern auch auf die Ursprünge ihres Malens unterschiedlich sind: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf eine banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch darin bestand, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er bei den Artiste Français aufgenommen würde\" (92).",
            "Viele bedeutende Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer fundamentalen Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seinem Gedicht \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" sagt: \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles, was man auf Erden weiß und alles, was man wissen muss.\" Vieles, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht über Bildung oder Erfahrung. Allerdings scheinen wir Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, wie Keats andeutet, ohne in diesen erwarteten Weisen unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind Versuche, zu beschreiben, nicht zu verschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind in der Regel Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literatur schöner ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, nicht eine Reihe von Regeln zur Beurteilung oder Erschaffung guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens. Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann die Essenz des Guten oder Schönen nie vollständig einfangen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von da Vincis Mona Lisa zum Beispiel könnte sich um Begriffe wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Stattdessen ist es üblich, wenn man nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder einer Lieblingsliteratur gefragt wird, eine Phrase wie \"Es gibt einfach etwas daran\" zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Qualitäten reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das nicht auf andere Weise gesagt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Erklärung unzureichend wäre.\" Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt immer etwas Transzendentales. Ich glaube, dass Ethik dieselbe Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: \"Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses 'etwas', diese \"je ne sais quoi\", ist, was den mächtigsten Aspekt von Kunst und Moral ausmacht, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet. Ich glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir sie beide am mächtigsten auf einer noemalen Ebene, im Kant'schen Sinne, erleben. Sie wirken auf einer Ebene, die erlebt werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: \"Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was sie tatsächlich einzigartig macht, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es könnte sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste, wie Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen so relevant für die Literatur wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte. ... Literatur ist uns wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir suchen.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany, as we now know it, comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.). Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premises. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "I stared down, mind blankly comprehending the view before me. Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared. So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at.\nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study. Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.\nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.\nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind's will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenager behind the wheel: the statistics are alarming. Several factors combine to create this deadly trend for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem is that the teenager's brain is not yet ready for the dangers of driving. Inexperience also plays a significant role. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also fare worse when they drive with their peers, which, as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows, happens regularly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that revealed the following correlation: the older the passenger, the fewer traffic accidents occur.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to increase teen driver safety by implementing temporary provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, in my view, these provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The root problem is that, as a group, the youngest drivers, by all statistical measures, are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research has shown that young people under 19-20 frequently engage in risky behavior for the thrill. It makes sense, therefore, to delay driving at least until this tendency has subsided. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we will not only see more deadly accidents but the death toll could skyrocket in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue could be quite straightforward. Schools could continue to teach driver's education to begin the learning process, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, and a certain number of practical driver's training hours would still be required. The specific number of hours could be based on the majority of states' requirements (in California, for example, this is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the deadly statistics for teen drivers are not confined to one state, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and, I believe, effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not a new idea.",
            "In den späten 1890er und frühen 1900er Jahren gab es in der Library of Congress eine Sammlung von frühen Filmen von Edison, insgesamt 15 Filme aus den Jahren 1895 bis 1901. Diese Filme nutzen oft kreative Schnitte, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudien konzentrierten sich darauf, die ästhetischen Merkmale der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionsbiographischen Merkmale in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Trickfilme zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts sind im Allgemeinen in einer festen Kulisse, innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums, gedreht und haben keine Kamerabewegungen, verwenden lange und mittlere Einstellungen und befolgen die strenge Regel, dass ein Schuss gleich einem Film entspricht.\n\nAllerdings gibt es einige Filme am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Regeln brechen, indem sie mehrere Einstellungen einführen. Ein gemeinsames Merkmal, das alle Trickfilme aufweisen, ist, dass sie in einer Innenkulisse innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums gedreht werden. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Proszeniumposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und geht auf das Theater und im speziellen Fall auf Varietéshows und Zauberkunststücke zurück. Eine Einschränkung der Verwendung einer Bühne ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen in der Regel nur von links nach rechts und vice versa wandern und nicht zur Kamera hin oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich hin und her entlang der Horizontalachse. Auch wenn sie den Bildausschnitt verlassen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDie frontale Proszeniumkomposition bedeutet auch, dass die Einstellungen oft lang und seltener mittel sind. Nahaufnahmen gibt es in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog. Dies folgt der Theater- und Varietétradition, in der das Publikum die gesamte Vorstellung zur selben Zeit sieht, die durch die Grenzen der Bühne gerahmt ist. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler auch nicht aus dem Mittelfeld zur Kamera hin, sodass Nahaufnahmen nicht vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Schuss gleich einem Film ist. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von der Anzahl der Bilder pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Varietétats wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschtricks mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Schuss für den Betrachter nicht immer einem physischen Schuss entspricht. Ein einzelner \"Schuss\" kann tatsächlich mehrere sein, die zusammengefügt werden, um den Eindruck von Apperenz oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich genau \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), einen der frühen Trickfilme, an. Eine genauere Untersuchung zeigt den Zeitpunkt, an dem der physische Schuss mit dem abgetrennten \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film für den Betrachter konzeptionell ein einziger Schuss ist.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent proponent of Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, his profession along with his brief political career made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the basis for almost all of his views on government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government. He strongly believed in the natural rights of man and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was man's motivation in all things, but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was somewhat disheartening and the reason for this decline is not entirely clear. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is a noticeable drop in people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which might account for some part of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might have simply slipped off the radar for many people. Additionally, December brings the start of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, and this might also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, none of this really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also speculate that any project of this nature is likely to experience an initial burst of energy and excitement that then naturally declines. In an attempt to fight this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to try and revitalize the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we faced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement and the specific problem of holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to offer incentives for alternative modes of commuting. We offered many prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to counteract that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes did not change significantly during the course of the project. If the prizes had increased in value over time, this might have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start of the project, but announcing a couple of bicycles in December and then a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than decreasing it.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist. For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\nIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dreamland ist eines von Edgar Allan Poes selbst als besser empfundenen Gedichten. In \"Dream-Land\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in Versen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil nutzte diesen Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als das Ende der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil diesen Begriff verwendet hat, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der etwas Anerkennung zusteht. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert.\n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil er Poes Vertrautheit mit den Schriften Goethes zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poe’s Politian und Goethe’s Mignon\", deutet die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitiert haben könnte.\n\nDas Oxford Companion to English Literature beschreibt Goethe als einen berühmten Schriftsteller der lyrischen Dramen,\"Faust\", die in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurden, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr des Todes Goethes, 1832. Im lyrischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Fausts liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thule\". Es handelt sich um einen König, der nach dem Tod seiner Frau, die ihm ein Kelch geschenkt hat, zu trinken beginnt und weint. Er entscheidet dann, dass es an der Zeit ist zu sterben und gibt seine Besitztümer seinen Kindern, behält aber den Kelch. Er geht zu einem Felsen, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Verhalten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich und könnten eine dunkle Kopie von Poes Verlust und seiner Abhängigkeit vom Trinken sein. Faust wurde auch von H.P. Grattan in 1842 in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" lag.\n\nPoe bezieht sich zweimal auf Thule in seinen gesammelten Schriften. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" verwendet er den Begriff \"ultma Thule\", aber er nutzt diesen Ausdruck auch in \"Dream-Land\" als Rahmen des Gedichts. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Dream-Land\" können als companion pieces gelesen werden. Im \"Dream-Land\" beschreibt der Sprecher die Landschaft von Thule als dunkel und einsam, er wird von toten Freunden verfolgt und sieht eine farblose Welt. All diese Szenen könnten in \"Der König von Thule\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat und sich einsam fühlt und seine Willenskraft verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht beschreibt, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre.\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Schriftsteller, den Poe sicherlich gekannt haben musste, allein schon aus Respekt für Tennyson. Als Poe nach seiner Meinung zu Tennyson gefragt wurde, sagte er, dass er ihn neben der Verbindung zu Tennyson auch durch die vielen Nachdrucke, die nach der ersten Veröffentlichung stattfanden, mit Goethes Werken vertraut gemacht wurde.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to clean it up for half an hour because he was having dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim summarily. To claim punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple customers were injured from slipping in the months before her accident, and despite this knowledge, he failed to clean up the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less persuasive but reasonable considering the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the same day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a partial summary motion against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally witnessed the media in America shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam. I don’t think that in 2001 we could have imagined a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who had a clear Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet intrigues me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, it contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From my past knowledge and learning, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a sort of martyr, who was misinterpreted and even humbled himself before others. After which, one by one, people began to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the authors intended Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet, who did not need to prove anything but lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is as if they are trying to steal credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, there are many stories in the biography that seem to serve as proof of ‘witness’ or how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam. However, the problem is that many of these stories are from a third-party perspective. The author illustrates that he heard these stories from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so, and so on. I did not like this approach because, although their intention was to provide proof of the truth of the stories, it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try to exalt and elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think that Muslims today might not know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today's world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the original intent of the religion's namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire. But later, that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus' lifetime?\nIf we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle illustrates how humans deep down are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only look out for themselves and want to make their lives as good as possible, but they never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The book shows this in many ways. The most obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They don't care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their progress. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They don't care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also didn't care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Manche Autoren verwenden verschiedene Methoden, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine bestimmte Einstellung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind wirksamer als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald nutzt viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman \"Der große Gatsby\". Manchmal paart er ein Adjektiv und ein Nomen, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und nutzt es dann zu diesem Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In \"Der große Gatsby\" baut Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere für Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet diese Bedeutungen später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl gegenüber einem wichtigen Objekt zu vermitteln.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und nutzt, ist Uniformität, wobei Weiß etwas freundlicher und höherwertiger ist und Grau älter und verflogen. Fitzgerald etabliert diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans durch die wiederholte Verwendung beider Farben. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - in der Tat tragen alle immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellhosen\" (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\" (36), wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"pulverweiß\" (30) gepudert. In Wirklichkeit tragen Menschen nur dann etwas anderes als Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party beschreibt: \"die Korridore... sind bunt mit Primärfarben\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter durch die Farbgebung vieler alltäglicher, unwichtiger Dinge: Als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Abgründe der unteren New York\" (56) hinab, die Namen der Menschen bei Gatsbys Partys sind nun \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, und die Wohnung von Catherine ist \"eine Scheibe in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Appartement-Häusern\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch alltägliche oder unwichtige Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Mädchenzeit\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Länder\" (23) im Tal der Asche, das \"italienische Kind\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26), und der Hundebezügler ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27). Nachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, nutzt er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Uniformität gegenüber bestimmten Themen zu vermitteln. Dies beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne eine signifikante Verwendung von entweder von diesen Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in Weiß\" (74) gekleidet in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\" ; die Leser fangen an, Daisy als weniger als eine Figur, sondern mehr wie eine uniforme Ergänzung zu sehen, etwas, das Gatsby will und nach dem er strebt. Fitzgerald verwendet diese Technik weiter um Daisy herum, um den Eindruck zu verstärken, dass Daisy mehr eine uniforme Ergänzung ist, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Hauch von Daisys Pelzkragen\" (18) und sie trägt wieder ein \"weißes\" (115) Kleid vor dem Treffen mit Tom und Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nA suitable piece of property was selected from a real estate website and available government programs were researched to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Kultur spielt eine wesentliche Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann definiert werden als viel mehr, was sie nicht ist, als das, was sie tatsächlich ist, und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist nicht homogen, noch ist sie eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht einheitlich oder uniform. Aussagen wie “alle Russen sind stur” oder “alle Japaner sind anpassungsfähig” sind in sich selbst gewaltig und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis der allgemeinen Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es für einen Verhandler vielmehr produktiv, die Bedeutung der Kultur im Hinblick auf das Thema und wie die Einstellung der Kultur die Gespräche am Verhandlungstisch beeinflussen kann, zu verstehen. Wenn man eine fremde Kultur trifft, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche sind unvermeidlich.\n\nDas Verständnis einer fremden Kultur oder Mentalität kann alles von der Untersuchung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zum Erkennen ihrer Vorurteile umfassen. Anstatt zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, eine Kultur zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders insbesondere in der Verhandlung, und besonders dann, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch tritt. Ebenso, wenn ein Verhandler sich auf “fremdem” Terrain befindet, kann Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen nur dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass sich Kultur nicht notwendigerweise auf eine nationale/Internationale Zweiteilung beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb einer gegebenen Nation schaffen ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur die Arbeit im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Zeichen einer Unternehmenskultur lassen sich in der Kleidung der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkt vs. indirekt, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungsmethoden erkennen. Einige Unternehmen fördern das Engagement von Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene der Mitarbeiter, während andere es auf “genehmigte” Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen beschränken. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und tatsächlich besteht innerhalb einer Gesellschaft auch innerhalb eines Unternehmens eine große Vielfalt, auch von Region zu Region, einschließlich städtischer und Vorort-Umgebungen) betrachten, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur wohnen können. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht so geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden möglicherweise einheitlicher, aber ein solches Äußeres ist nur ein Zeichen, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind sogar wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den Grundsatz einer Kultur darstellen. Wenn es in einer Kultur darum geht, das Gesicht zu wahren oder Gemeinschaftsharmonie, ist es sicherlich, dass ein Verhandler seinen Arbeitgeber oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich blamieren wird, um am Verhandlungstisch zu triumphieren. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, der ein harter Handeln einen höheren Stellenwert einräumt, nicht unbedingt dazu gedrängt sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einem Abschluss zu kommen. Diese allgemeinen Erkenntnisse sollten berücksichtigt werden, bevor man sich an den Verhandlungstisch begibt. Allerdings ist ein Verhandler gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effizient zu gestalten.",
            "Der Narr sprach in seinem Herzen: „Es gibt keinen Gott.“ Diese Aussage findet sich erstmals in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und erscheint als Einführung in die Argumentation von St. Anselm über das Dasein Gottes. Es scheint, dass auch der andere Autor, den wir diskutieren werden, Thomas Aquinas, diese Überzeugung teilt. Da beide ihre Argumente in der Verteidigung desselben Konzeptes ausführen und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu entscheiden, welches der beiden besser ist, müssen wir, um der Kürze willen, davon ausgehen, dass beide in der Existenz Gottes, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen. Die Annahme eines Gottes, der nicht dem einer ähnlichen Vorstellung entspricht, würde einen adäquaten Vergleich ihrer beiden Argumente nicht zulassen, da sie im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung einer bestimmten Gottesvorstellung beitragen. Es ist zu vermuten, dass beide jeweils wertvolle Punkte ansprechen, aber keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\n\nUm dies zu veranschaulichen, untersucht man zunächst die Grundidee von St. Anselm. Anselms Passage reflektiert einen Weg zur Erkenntnis durch den Glauben und den Blick in das eigene Innere, um Beweise für Gottes Existenz zu finden. Er erklärt, dass, weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, wir ihn nicht effektiv als nichtexistent denken können. Während diese Idee in seiner Terminologie etwas schwerfällig und manchmal unklar ist, besteht das grundlegende Konzept darin, dass die Beweisführung für Gott innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes liegt. St. Anselm schlägt vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz eines solchen Wesens nur durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir als wahr wissen, in unseren eigenen Geistern gefunden wird. Fremde Beweise sind angeblich nicht notwendig. Diese Idee, die Annahme dessen, für das es keine unumstößliche empirische Evidenz gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee steht im Gegensatz zu der von St. Thomas Aquinas vertretenen. Thomas stattet die Existenz Gottes durch pure Vernunft und empirische Beweise aus, ohne dass der Glaube eine Rolle spielt. Eine solche Idee wäre vorteilhaft für die Missionierung, einem wichtigen Aspekt des Christentums, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Convertiten ermöglichen würde, ohne von deren Bereitschaft abhängig zu sein, etwas Unbewiesenes anzunehmen. Stattdessen könnten sie durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas führt fünf verschiedene logische Argumente zur Unterstützung der Gottesexistenz vor: Veränderung, Ursache, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem Fall zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn dir erklärt wird, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du die anderen Teile zusammensetzt, so zwingt dich die Logik, die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Puzzleteils zu kennen, ohne es sehen zu müssen.",
            "Einmal im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages als Buddha bekannt sein würde. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er die Welt auf und erlangte die Erleuchtung, und seine Lehren führten zur Gründung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Dies ist in vielen Bereichen ersichtlich, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasserritual gefeiert wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen daran teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gesprochen hat. Diese Unterschiede erstrecken sich von oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zu den soteriologischen Grundlagen der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinde, sowohl aus der monastischen Perspektive als auch aus der der Laien, hat im Laufe der Zeit ihre doctrinalen Prinzipien ändern müssen. Dies ist sowohl auf äußere als auch auf innere Einflüsse, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende zurückzuführen.\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Begriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Dazu gehört der Begriff von inneren versus äußeren Kräften. Hier wird eine innere Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasana stammt, unabhängig von deren monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder ihr schaden will – eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft nicht schaden will, die jedoch möglicherweise doch schaden kann oder auch hilft – sei es als Nebenwirkung. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet.\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Zentrum des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Dreifachjuwel des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den drei Körben – dem Tripitaka – der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Sutras, der Vinaya Pitaka die disziplinären Regeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Konzepte umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – das inhärente Leiden im Leben und Anicca – die Unbeständigkeit alles. Erst durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der unablässig ist. Mit dem Ende von Sansara endet auch Lobha – Begierde, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Verblendung, wenn man erleuchtet ist. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden die Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde nicht unkeusch sein und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinäre Regeln zu befolgen. Die fundamentale doctrinale Idee im Buddhismus ist die Lehre der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that at one time were burdened by a long-lasting rivalry that endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The height of this rivalry was marked by the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, and these tensions gradually subsided just before the First World War. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as major conflicts of material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is not uncommon for neighboring nations, which often have conflicting interests that lead to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are not unique in this regard. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American nations have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues have created a rift between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similarly, the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests considered vital by each nation. In this case, however, the ideological disputes were rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust was inherited from the distrust between the English and Spanish. These feelings of distrust, carried over from their colonial rulers, posed a significant obstacle to the establishment of friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. The majority of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a major issue that persisted until both the United States and Mexico enforced military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security that I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a little of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, here I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call my own. I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D’Arcy Thompson stated that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Since 2012, Indonesia has seen little change in neonatal and infant mortality rates. Despite progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health have fallen short of the 2015 goals. We will explore the reasons for this below, pointing to a need to bolster the health system rather than focus on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has increased the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers to 72%, but this still includes traditional birth attendants like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions for complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. Improvements in this area are misleading, and there's still much to do. Additionally, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrhea by healthcare professionals has decreased.\n\nData on postnatal care is incomplete, but it's clear that this area is also problematic with low rates nationwide. C-section rates are still low, at around 4%, with urban areas seeing 7% and rural areas 2%. This highlights equity issues, as access to healthcare services is primarily in urban areas. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access care due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen planning next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or strengthen the overall health system? Programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable objectives and quicker results. However, they can lead to funding shortages and human resource imbalances, with programs attracting more resources. Additionally, parallel programs for one area can result in service duplication and uncoordinated efforts, leading to increased paperwork and bureaucracy.",
            "Victorian Romane zeichnen sich durch ihre ausführliche Detailgenauigkeit und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der damaligen Zeit aus. Zwei Romane, die von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Werke nutzen ein Element des Mystery und eine Vorliebe für das Absonderliche, was für die damaligen Romane untypisch ist und die Charaktere in jedem Werk stärken; sie bieten Einblicke in ihre Motive und Emotionen.\n\n“Und nun drängten sich unzählige verwirrende und verwirrende Ideen in seinen Geist. Es schien, als ob er noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit ginge, die sich wütend stritten; denn die Worte, die sie sagten, hallten in seinen Ohren wider; und als er seine Aufmerksamkeit wieder auf sich selbst lenkte, … fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich zuckte er zusammen, als er den Schuss hörte; und aus der Luft erhoben sich laute Schreie und Rufe; Lichter blitzten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Chaos, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilig fortschleppte. Durch all diese raschen Visionen zog ein unbestimmtes, unruhiges Bewusstsein für den Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich quälte.\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen diese Mystery oft durch Träume oder träumerische Zustände, wobei der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variiert. In Oliver Twist offenbaren diese eigenartigen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn quält und seine Erkenntnisse über die wahre Natur der um ihn herum geschehenen Dinge. Als die Schießerei in Kapitel 28 wieder aufgerufen wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft, als ob er träumte, während er verzweifelt nach Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont Olivers fehlende Kontrolle über die Ereignisse, die sich abspielten, sowie die bedenkliche Lage seiner Gesundheit, die durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit stark präsent ist. Die Schießerei überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, er bemerkt die “unsichtbare Hand” nicht, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seinen Schmerz wieder, entfernt von der Überraschung des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun ständig und mit Angst verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück verursachte, da es sicher nicht sein eigenes war. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver über nichts Kontrolle hat, und kann sich nicht einmal bemühen, die Kontrolle über das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu erlangen, nicht einmal, wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch durch diesen Abschnitt angedeutet, als ob alter Fagin ihn brechen würde, indem er ihn dazu bringt, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren, was seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, beeinflusst. Andernfalls könnte man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest einen Versuch unternommen hätte, zumindest um seines eigenen Lebens willen.\n\nDer Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war gekommen und gegangen, so schnell wie der nächste kam; und die Nacht brach wieder herein; eine lange, lange Nacht und doch so kurz; lang in ihrer schrecklichen Stille und kurz in ihrem fluchtartigen Vergehen.” (Dickens, 220)",
            "Ein paar Jahre ago, arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, bei dem ich Elementarschüler unterrichtete. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in ihren jeweiligen Fächern zu helfen, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englisch- und Lesenunterricht. Eine der Lehrerinnen rekrutierte mich, um einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen, der große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen hatte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse). Es wurde mir schnell klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere nicht einmal annähernd. Du weißt, er war Lateinamerikaner und sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir kämpften uns weiter, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich war gerade dabei, ein paar Kinder zu betreuen, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr geringen Spanischkenntnissen (ich hatte gerade erst angefangen, es zu lernen) kamen wir irgendwie miteinander aus. Es war dann, als mir der Groschen fiel: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur die englischen Buchstaben nicht richtig. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Einsicht ihm wirklich viel half, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser dran ist.\n\nDiese Geschichte erzähle ich, um auf das Problem des Sprachbarrieren in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, aufmerksam zu machen. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, alle können zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also: Was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Nachhilfe im Englischlesen, besonders im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Die duale Sprachsystem, der Mainstreamansatz, private Nachhilfe, ESL-Klassen – keine dieser Methoden, für sich allein, wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, alle diese Ansätze zu kombinieren!\n\nZuerst einmal ist das duale Sprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungseinrichtungen haben sich akademisch besser entwickelt als ihre Mitschüler“, heißt es. Es gibt viele Ängste, dass dies eine Ressourceverschwendung sei und dass die meisten Kinder in den Schulen keine Vorteile davon hätten. Aber das ist nicht wahr. Wenn wir solche Programme in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, statt als Ausnahme, anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir vor? Müssen wir alle Lehrer bilingual sein? Nein, das wäre unrealistisch und unvernünftig. Aber ich denke, es gibt keinen Grund, warum wir nicht spezialisierte Helfer, Tutor*innen oder wie man sie auch nennen möchte, haben könnten, die bilingual sind.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too. He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define. What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have begun to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as:\n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",
            "Die Lieferkettenverwaltung ist der Fluss von Prozessen, die die Waren von der Kundenbestellung über die Rohstoffphase, Versorgung, Produktion und Verteilung von Produkten an den Kunden bringt. Der Begriff \"Supply Chain Management\" wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Umsetzung und Steuerung dessen, was auf der Lieferkette passiert, um Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu befriedigen. Es gibt sechs wesentliche Elemente in einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsmanager nutzen diese sechs wesentlichen Elemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Sie bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles hergestellt wird. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Um dies zu erfahren, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator dafür, was die Kunden nachfragen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und in welcher Menge. Nach der Entscheidung, was produziert und in welcher Menge hergestellt werden soll, sind die Manager bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welche Fabrik am besten für die Volumen- und Qualitätsanforderungen geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenbedürfnisse und -zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen. Sobald der Produktionsort festgelegt ist, konzentrieren sich die Manager auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Wartung der Geräte. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist entscheidend im gesamten Prozess. Wenn jedes Detail nicht ordnungsgemäß geplant wird, kann dies dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben für jede Geschäftseinheit ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess. Es gibt eine vorgegebene Anordnung, wie eine Mitarbeiteruniform aussehen soll, bis hin zum Empfang von LKW-Lieferungen. Diese festgelegten Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über die Richtung und Erwartungen.",
            "Hitler lives in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard high above her head. The unsettling message is written on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, there were several street protests, the first public protests in a decade. Led by many Burmese monks, these protests were known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial unrest, the public became more involved, and while the government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, violence escalated into what some considered a full-scale war between the monks and the military junta. The military attacked and looted monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, said, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. Governments' desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over their citizens has existed since the dawn of civilization. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to rule every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to be gods sent to lead their people to prosperity through inventions like Motorola cell phones and seppuku. Our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nWell-known examples of these actions include the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the authoritarian government. The death toll varies widely, with official Chinese government reports stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s is another example, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich,' a period spanning several years and countries where people of Jewish background were rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellingtons Vermächtnis im Jazz resultiert weitgehend aus seiner Langlebigkeit und seinen kreativen Fähigkeiten, die sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, doch als Komponist war er herausragend dabei, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder in den Vordergrund stellen. Er hat den Rahmen geschaffen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, und gleichzeitig eng orchestrierte Stücke und Phrasen geschrieben, die auf den speziellen Stil der Bandmitglieder verwiesen, um musikalische Ideen zu unterstreichen. Auf diese Weise hat er auch den Klang des Orchesters insgesamt betont und originale, zusammenhängende Klänge für jedes Stück geschaffen. Ellingtons Meisterschaft über die individuellen Klänge der Spieler sowie deren Zusammenwirken in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Lexikon beschreibt in Bezug auf Ellingtons Klang und Innovation die \"Creole Love Call\" als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme als \"Jazz-Instrument\" in seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Fähigkeit, die Stimme einzusetzen, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne den Lyrikschranken zu unterliegen. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere hindurch zeigen lässt. Dieses langsame, gezielte bluesige Zwölftaktstück besteht aus sechs Chorussen, wie folgt:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und gegen Ende rauer wird.\n\nChorus 2: Muted Trumpet Solo, das die Grundmelodie ausführt und mehrere verlängerte Bluesnoten betont.\n\nChorus 3: Weitreichender Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, begleitet von einer subtilen synkopierten Klavierphrase.\n\nChorus 4: Volles Orchester wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call and response durch die Blech- und Holzbläserabteilungen.\n\nChorus 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stücks, bei dem die Holzbläser den Call and response in einem hohen Register beginnen, begleitet von synkopiertem Stop-Time von den Blech- und Rhythmusabteilungen.\n\nChorus 6: Zurück zur Struktur des ersten Choruses mit Call and response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus nimmt die Stimme den \"Growl\"-Klang an und spielt wie ein Instrument solo.\n\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einer Vocalrun und einem unkonventionellen dissonanten Trompetensolo-Ende.\n\nEllingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine zusätzliche Dimension von Tonfarbe zu verleihen, ist ein Beispiel für eine stilistische Eigenart, die sich durch seine gesamte Werkstatt durchzieht. In \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeiten in der engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für die Tonfarbe. Ein Call and response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley am muted Trumpet und Baby Cox' Scat-Singen nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley's Spiel und instrumentale Aspekte von Cox' Stimme, um einen reichen und ergänzenden Klang zu schaffen. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" führt diese Ideen weiter, indem Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine ständige Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf muted Trompete einzuführen.",
            "She had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat), and fish, while also featuring lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have reported an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies, however, did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified accordingly. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America experienced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most influential corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must ask the following questions: how did this crisis come about, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to grant sub-prime loans to an already immature and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves with inadequate capital reserves and transferred the resulting chaos to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and ultimately to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President was seeking a second term in office. To achieve this goal, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would follow seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMany factors combined to plunge the economy into chaos, one of which was the new and complex mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general becoming overleveraged in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, die Einführung! Dieser Punkt in deiner Geschichte, an dem du deine kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausstreckst und die Welt mit deinem magnetischen, ja zauberhaftem Prosa-Geschwurbel begeisterst. Oder der Teil, bei dem deine Leser einschlafen und/oder auf \"Zurück\" klicken, während sie deinen Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, dass sie an ihrem Monitor schreit, wenn sie sich in der Mitte von Too Much Information wiederfindet, und das nicht auf die gute Weise.\n\nDie Einführung ist dein Feind.\n\nDeine lieben Leser kennen bereits die grundlegende Schreibregel \"Show, don't tell\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch über lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert, oder noch schlimmer, zu viel. Die Einführung ist der kleine Teufel auf deiner Schulter, der dir sagt, dass du die Geschichte aus dem Weg schaffen sollst, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der dich dazu drängt, deinem Publikum jede Einzelheit aus den Kindertagen jedes Charakters zu erzählen).\n\nDie Einführung bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Sprache. Im Film findet die Einführung statt, wenn eine Figur der anderen eine Informationsspritze verpasst, wie in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". In der Fiktion tut das der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist hier angebracht. Wenn du eine Geschichte liest und erfährst, dass die Heldin ihren geliebten Partner an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie in einer prunkvollen Weise geheiratet haben und dass ihr Mann ihr vor den Augen getötet wurde, würdest du nicht erwarten, dass diese entire Sequenz zwei Seiten in Anspruch nimmt, während beide nur zwei Zeilen haben. Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor Zeit in die Charakterentwicklung des Ehemanns investiert, indem er durch seine Sprache und seinen Stil zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest ebenfalls erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Gesten zeigt, wie sehr das Vorhandensein ihres Lebens in ihrem Leben zu Veränderungen und Bereicherung geführt hat (vor allem, wenn die Geschichte dir später direkt erzählt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine angemessene Einführung in den Ehemann würde dir ermöglichen, emotional in sein Schicksal involviert zu sein und Einblicke in die Charaktere der Heldin zu gewinnen: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, reflektiert durch den Spiegel seiner Augen, und so weiter. Du würdest seinen Tod mit ihr trauern und dich so enger mit der Heldin selbst verbinden.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass du dem simplem Knochen der Handlung Fleisch hinzufügst: \"Sie trafen sich, heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller musst du das Fleisch liefern. (*schaut auf das Metaphern, seufzt, setzt seinen Weg fort*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, bestimmte Dinge zu übergehen. Vielleicht führst du einen neuen Charakter ein und weißt, dass er früher in der Air Force war, jetzt Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zwei Mal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, am Wochenende gerne fischen geht, im Geheimen davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und am Morgen Eier Benedict hatte.",
            "Ich habe zwei Nachrichtenberichte aus Columbus, Ohio gesehen. Der erste Bericht, der live war, kam von NBC 4 heute Morgen (August 13, 2011). Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name war Shad Hostettler, und es wurde kein Name der Frau genannt. Sie zeigten sein Foto und er sah aus wie der pure Böse. Sie widmeten diesem Bericht etwa zwei Minuten, da die Entwicklung noch im Gange war. Die einzigen Details, die sie gaben, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und verhaftet worden war. Ich denke, sie haben diesem Bericht eine angemessene Zeit gewidmet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem frühen Morgen-Schuss auf Travis Buyers, 18 Jahre alt. Er wurde in der Sharon Woods Area angeschossen und war in kritischem Zustand; es gab zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team untersuchte den Vorfall. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das könnte daran gelegen haben, dass es sich um einen \"schwarzen\" Mann oder eine \"schwarze\" Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe (und das schon seit Jahren) bemerkt, dass Minderheiten bei einem Verbrechen oft übersehen werden. Wenn zum Beispiel ein \"weißes\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder ein Opfer eines Verbrechens ist, wird die Medienwelt verrückt; aber wenn es sich um eine Minderheit handelt, ist es froh, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Einschussloch, das in einem Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden wurde. Details dazu, wo der Vorfall passiert sein könnte, wurden gegeben. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr gehandelt hatte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten für Hinweise, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen, eine Belohnung von 5.000 Dollar an.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Einbruch in einen UDF an Clime Road in Columbus. Es wurde gesagt, dass es sich um einen Mann mit dunkler Hautfarbe handelte, der den Laden überfallen hatte. Er trug einen Hoodie-Sweatshirt und war etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wog etwa 68 Kilogramm. Ich fand es ungewöhnlich, dass sie so viel Zeit damit verbrachten, zu betonen, dass er schwarz ist und wie dunkel er ist.\n\nEin weiterer Bericht handelte von einem Rene Rodriguez, der als texanischer Drogenboss verhaftet worden war. Er war wegen des Versuchs, Marihuana in großen Mengen von Texas nach Ohio zu verteilen, verurteilt worden. Ein merkwürdiger Punkt, den ich bemerkte, war, dass sie anstatt zu sagen, dass er 25 Jahre Gefängnis bekommen hatte, sagten \"300\" Monate. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was dahintersteckte, ob sie dachten, das klang härter oder was. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann war, ich denke, das war nicht wirklich relevant für die Geschichte.",
            "Es gibt eine tiefe Verbindung zwischen Brüdern; eine unauflösliche, unaufhebbares Band. In dieser Verbindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen sich, weit mehr als jemand anderes mit einer solchen Verbindung, und sie sehen sich selbst nur in ihrem Bruder. Es ist in den scheinbar aussichtslosesten Situationen, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Gefühle sich zeigen, tragen sie eine hohe Kosten. Ein Teil des Verstehens der Gefühle, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung entstehen, besteht darin, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn jemand seinem Bruder in die Augen sieht, erkennt er sich selbst darin nicht so, wie andere ihn sehen, sondern so, wie er wirklich ist. In seinen Taten und den Konsequenzen dieser Taten liegt seine wahre Charakter. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die wilden Emotionen, die damit verbunden sind. Durch eine üppige, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft setzen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert mit intensiver Stolz in der entscheidenden Szene, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihren Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Sicht des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum kommuniziert, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen einwirken.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf eine einzige Gefühl zurückführen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, das erste Mal zusammen unterwegs sind, bis zu ihrer letzten, tragischen Expedition, empfindet der Protagonist Ressentiment gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, den er alle seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten lehren könnte, wie \"… Luft anzuhalten, laufen, springen oder auf den Ranken im Old Woman Swamp klettern…\". Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle eines \"…jemandem zu dem man bis Horsehead Landing rennt…und jemandem, mit dem man auf der oberen Gabelung des großen Pins hinter dem Scheune sitzt…\" einnehmen könnte. Offensichtlich sind solche Dinge unmöglich, da Doodle mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren wurde, was seine Überlebenschancen stark mindert. Und selbst wenn es fast unmöglich wäre, dass er je anstrengende körperliche Aktivitäten ausübt. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilden Fantasien ist, dass all diese Träume so schnell zerschlagen werden. Tatsächlich wird gezeigt, dass er sogar eine gewisse Wut auf das kleine Kind hat, als er daran denkt, ihn durch Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu töten. Welcher Kind hätte die Geistesgegenwart, um Infanticide in Betracht zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so simple Handlung kann dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung geben! Das zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark ist. In seinem Hinterkopf hat er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.",
            "The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind as you learn about the brain that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions. Information processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple information like color, orientation, and object borders, where color changes significantly over a short space, to recognize it as a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made at some steps in the bottom-up process to speed up recognition. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background. Once information has been processed to a certain degree, an attention filter determines its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For instance, even though your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name even if spoken in a noisy room. There are many processing stages, and processing results are modulated by attention repeatedly. For the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded, with different encoding types for each sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons for a short period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins. There are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are concept nodes and that these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley kritisiert in \"Brave New World\" die aufkommende Bedrohung durch Technologie und die kapitalistische Struktur, die diese stärkt, indem sie eine dystopische Gesellschaft schafft. In dieser Gesellschaft wird Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen gestellt, und die Menschen werden von Anfang an so konditioniert, dass sie das Streben nach sofortiger Glückseligkeit über alles andere stellen. Die Bürger werden als Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die in einer Ideologie leben, die vom World Controller vorgegeben wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes mit marxistischen Augenwinkeln wird die heimliche Skepsis des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung dieser Systeme deutlich. Begriffe wie Homogenität und Reifikation aus der Marxismus unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Fehlern der aufstrebenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch die Marxistische These der falschen Bewusstsein kritisiert. Die Normalbürger werden daran gehindert, die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen zu erkennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihrem eigenen Vorteil interessiert sind. Dies ist das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle der Proletarier und der einfachen Arbeiter, was in der Conditionierung der Menschen im Brave New World deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, wie Delta und Gamma, haben keinen wahren eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Antrieb zu Konsum, Ausgeben und Indulgen gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass soziale Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen total dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall deutlich. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst, sie \"kaufen\" quasi eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (also Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Möglichkeit geboren, dies zu erkennen, tun aber nichts; selbst Alphas oder Betas wie Bernard tun wenig mehr, als ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie weiter ausgeführt wird, bedeutsame Indikationen der wahrgenommenen Kapitalismusoppression.\n\nIn Brave New World gibt es keine Beziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen. Der Roman scheint sich weigern, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden; selbst bei den Hauptfiguren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley damit sagen, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen dem Menschen die Freiheit und Ausdrucksmöglichkeit nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme irgendeines Gefühls; Interaktionen bleiben oberflächlich, dargestellt durch die Kommentare der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf deren körperliche Attraktivität beziehen, und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen. Zudem zeigt die allgemeine Zufriedenheit der gesellschaftlichen Schichten mit ihrem Platz im Hierarchie den sozioökonomischen Einfluss des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Unterordnung in der Gemeinschaft zeigt den Marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat wider, das sich selbst einen falschen Überlegenheitsgefühl geben lässt, solange es weiter konsumiert, sich unterordnet und in der Spur der Gleichaltrigen bleibt.",
            "Ich habe in diesem Semester etwa zwei Jahre und vierzehn Monate studiert, das sind auch vier und ein halbes Semester. Für viele, einschließlich mir, ist es schwierig, sich auf dem Campus zu bewegen. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls Wohnheim untergebracht; das ist im Wesentlichen der östlichste Punkt des Campus, ausgenommen das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center. Der Weg von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu meinen Vorlesungen in so weit entfernten Gebäuden wie dem Willard Building, das sich in der Mitte des Campus befindet, konnte bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders bei schlechter Witterung, wie sie häufig in State College vorkommt. Ein Absolvent, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erzählte mir, dass die East Halls Wohnheime nicht lange her von einem großen ungenutzten Landstück getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportplätzen, neuen Gebäuden wie dem neuen Creamery und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstgebäude gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Während unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es schwieriger und schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Welche ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Ein Fahrrad allein wird jedoch keine Probleme lösen. Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch unterhielt mich mit einem Freund, der erst kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder mit dem Fahrradfahren angefangen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragt, warum er jemals aufgehört hat. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „ein paar Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben der Tatsache, dass es gut für den Körper ist, ist Radfahren die effizienteste Art zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung können dich 30 Meilen oder mehr bringen. Wie viele andere Erstsemester lebe auch ich abseits des Campus, genau so weit weg von der Campusmitte wie einige Wohnheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Vorlesungen im Thomas Building, das etwa 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit einem Fahrrad kann man diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn man schnell pedalt. Das Problem ist nur, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas Building von meinem Haus aus ist, und es ist nicht immer leicht, diese Straße zu befahren, egal ob mit oder ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt auch Vieles zu sagen für das Gehen, aber ich bin zu beschäftigt, um zu gehen. Wenn ich mein Fahrrad nicht hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Möglichkeit, zum Unterricht zu kommen. Ein tägliches Gehen zum Thomas Building würde mir extra 30-40 Minuten meines Tages kosten. Das sind über zwei und ein halbes Stunden pro Woche. Hinzu kommt all die Zeit, die ich für den Weg zu und vom Unterricht, zu Terminen und so weiter aufwenden müsste. Das ist zu viel Zeit, die ich nicht erübrigen kann."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Im Studium der Sozialarbeit möchte ich eine Karriere im Bereich Familie und Kinder-Dienste verfolgen, um Kindern, die missbraucht oder vernachlässigt wurden, zu helfen und unterstützend bei schwierigen Familien zu wirken. Werte, die ich in das Feld der Sozialarbeit einbringen kann, sind: Dienstleistung, Respekt, ethisches Verhalten, Engagement zur Verbesserung der Beziehungen zwischen anderen und zur eigenen beruflichen Weiterentwicklung, um in meinem Fachfeld kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur wichtig für Sozialarbeiter, sondern auch für mich persönlich.\n\nIch wollte schon immer anderen helfen, war mir aber unsicher, welchen Berufswunsch ich verfolgen sollte. Während meiner Zeit auf der High School und im College sah ich viele Menschen, die vor ihren Problemen flohen und weniger ideale Bewältigungsmechanismen nutzten. Aufgrund dieser Erlebnisse entschied ich mich, einen Bachelor in Psychologie zu verfolgen.noch immer unsicher, welchen Beruf ich verfolgen wollte, nahm ich mir nach meinem Abschluss an der Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 eine Auszeit. Eines Tages im Sommer besuchte ich eine Freundin, die mir einen 16-jährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrer Couch saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er zu Besuch war: um seinen gewalttätigen Eltern zu entkommen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu seinen Eltern gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich ihnen helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinen Eltern. Dort erklärte ich der Polizei meine Bedenken und sagte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Abschluss in Psychologie von der Piedmont College gemacht hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da es im Rechtlichen nichts für den Teenager gab. Als ich die Eltern befragte, schienen sie nervös zu sein und entschuldigten ihr Sohns Verhalten als „manipulativ“, indem er Außenstehende in einfache Streitigkeiten einbezog. Nach dieser Erfahrung begann ich ernsthaft zu überlegen, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit anzustreben, um Kindern in „einfachen“ Familienstreitigkeiten zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer wichtiger Wert für das Feld der Sozialarbeit ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist und trauern um die, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des „Einzelnen“, das die Gesellschaft hat, ist eher eine Nachahmung alter Traditionen als echte Einzigartigkeit. Wenn wir also um verlorene Individuen trauern, warum streben wir danach, wie „jeder andere“ zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, mich selbst einzuschränken, um wie andere zu sein. Während meiner Zeit auf der High School und im College protestierte ich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten, so oft ich konnte: indem ich meine Haare unnatürliche Farben färbte, Kleidung trug, die zu meiner Persönlichkeit passte, meine Ohren über traditionelle Grenzen hinaus piergte, meine Teilnahme an der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) erklärte, gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung kämpfte, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten protestieren.",
            "The following paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited, as well as the medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to highlight their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in falling or staying asleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is defined by difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep episodes. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice showed that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that animal models of mice can be generalized to human studies. This indicates that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could affect the ability to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and daily events that involve monotonous tasks and focus.",
            "This paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n(CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that although disguise can be useful for prolonged deception, ultimately one must shed this new identity or risk losing oneself. The challenge of ending a deception is the risk of isolation, as one must decide between self-preservation and maintaining relationships. While some may accept the deception, others will be deeply offended.\n\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises many issues, with the most significant being the motivation. Why does the subject feel the need to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it’s clear it's a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nUpon arriving in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from the women, cutting her off from a crucial support system. To make matters worse, her convincing portrayal as a man leads Olivia to confuse her with Sebastian and fall in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must deal with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this might seem progressive to a modern reader, Twelfth Night may also illustrate how deception can uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Certain passages suggest they might have unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia secretly harbor feelings for women? One might argue that this is unlikely, as Olivia seems more likely to judge others based solely on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Die deutsche Kolonialherrschaft wurde von verschiedenen Beobachtern für ihre Brutalität, insbesondere aufgrund des Völkermords an den Ovaherero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika, kritisiert. Natürlich kann ein so umfassendes Kolonialreich wie das deutsche nicht mit einer einfachen Beschreibung erklärt werden. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen Politiken und seiner Herrschaftsform so vielfältig wie in seiner Geografie. Die Bildungseinrichtungen in den Kolonien waren ebenfalls sehr unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 die Herrschaft über Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganyika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Zahl von gebildeten und alphabetisierten Afrikanern vor. Die deutschen Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heutiges Namibia) bot einen starken Kontrast. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen einrichtete und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der Bildung der Eingeborenen in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den Missionarsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete und die Missionars Schools stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese BildungsPolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien über erhebliche Zahlen an alphabetisierten und gebildeten Afrikanern verfügten, blieb die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch. Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu dieser unterschiedlichen Erfahrung in Südwestafrika. Dieser Artikel soll die Diskussion erweitern, indem er diese Faktoren identifiziert und insbesondere auf neue Forschung zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den Eingeborenen eingeht.\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zum Thema Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und stammen aus dem frühen 20. Jahrhundert, entweder während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft. Die frühen Werke hatten hauptsächlich das Ziel, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Werke in englischer Sprache erweiterten die Diskussion durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Die prominenteste Arbeit, die sich explizit mit dem Thema dieses Artikels befasst, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Nach Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung in Südwestafrika viele der unterscheidenden Merkmale des Kolonialsystems.\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen Kolonialbesitzungen Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein gemäßigt gemäßertes Klima, obwohl ein großer Teil des Gebiets von ariden Wüsten bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten etwa 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößeren Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.",
            "Die Einteilung der Populärmusik hat sich in den letzten 100 Jahren so stark weiterentwickelt, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres vollständig aufzulisten. Die Sache wird noch komplizierter durch die Tatsache, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – wie Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen – zahlreiche Unter- und Unteruntergenres innerhalb ihrer Sphäre hervorgebracht haben. Das Untergenre Heavy Metal Rock hat sich in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielseitigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der Populärmusik entwickelt. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es eine breite Palette an Emotionen zeigt, die jedoch oft dunkler Natur sind. Es ist vielseitig, weil die Menschen sehr früh erkannten, dass der Heavy Metal eine große Flexibilität bietet, die sie nutzen konnten, um eigene Unter- und Unteruntergenres zu schaffen, was bis heute weitergeht.\n\nHeute haben wir im Heavy Metal eine so große Vielfalt an Nischengruppen erreicht, dass es schwierig ist, genau zu sagen, was Heavy Metal eigentlich ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres integriert, aber wie alles andere hat es auch Wurzeln. Um die heutige Metal-Musik zu verstehen, muss man erst einmal verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert wird. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehrs“ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivität, mehr Fähigkeiten; die Musiker in Metal-Bands können wirklich gut spielen, und das hört man in der Musik. Metal ist auch, wie es wahrscheinlich kaum überraschend ist, eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen geprägt ist. Es gab in der Mitte der 70er Jahre eine psychedelische Drogenwelle, die die Menschen verrückter machte, was dazu führte, dass sie verrückte, andereweltliche Platinen aufnahmen, wobei die Drogen als Entschuldigung für ihre Schöpfung dienten. Es hat viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, was damals im Musikleben neu war, da eine große Menge an beliebter Musik Qualitäten hatte, die nicht dem dunklen Teil des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Spätere Generationen des Metals haben auch einige Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten, die so in der Romantik Ära vorhanden waren. Lyrics wie die folgenden drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Zeilen aus Helter Skelter zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Es stellt einen Auf und Ab dar, das angeblich von Drogen verursacht wurde. Dieses Lied wird von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy Metal Lieder betrachtet. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Lied der Rolling Stones, das auch schwerer und dunkler war. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer klingen konnten wie die Stones, und so brachten sie dieses Lied auf das Weiße Album.",
            "Einige Jahrzehnte vor den Surrealisten begannen, ihre traumhaften Werke zu malen, war Henri Rousseau damit beschäftigt, seine eigenen Träume, sowohl wörtlich als auch metaphorisch, zu erschaffen. \"Der Traum\", ein 1910er Gemälde des berühmten Post-Impressionisten, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die den Wundern der Landschaft staunt, die sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus persönliche Träume und Ziele als Künstler. Seit er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber, und stellte fest, dass er vor einer schwierigen inneren Zwickmühle stand, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. \"Der Traum\" ist Rousseaus Werk, das am besten seine jahrelange innere Schlacht widerspiegelt: sich entweder an bestimmte Malstile anzupassen oder sie nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so sehr verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder seine kreative Unabhängigkeit und Einzigartigkeit zu wahren und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man Rousseaus Lebensgeschichte kennen. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Töpfer und Metallwarenhändler, der \"bürgerlichen Wohlstand\" genoss (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, also Mitarbeiter des städtischen Gebührenkontors, obwohl er den Spitznamen \"douanier\", also Zollbeamter, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, gefolgt vom Tod von acht Kindertoten, ließ Rousseau nur eine Tochter namens Julia und immense Trauer zurück (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und widmete sich der Malerei, um ihm Trost und frischen Beginn zu bieten. Anders als seine zeitgenössischen Kollegen, die den peasants in der Malerei sentimentalisieren und romantisieren, ist Rousseau im Wesentlichen ein Volkskünstler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Fixierung darauf, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist im Kontext verständlich: wie bereits erwähnt, war er ungebildet im Bereich der formalen Malerei und begann seine Karriere in einem viel späteren Alter als viele andere talentierte und besser bekannte moderne Künstler. Obwohl er bereits viele Jahre gearbeitet hatte, erhielt Rousseau keine richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst, bis etwa zur gleichen Zeit, als Matisse begann, sich als Künstler einen Namen zu machen. Im Buch \"Modern French Painters\" behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden nicht nur in Bezug auf Stil und Thema, sondern auch auf die Ursprünge ihres Malens unterschiedlich sind: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf eine banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch darin bestand, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er bei den Artiste Français aufgenommen würde\" (92).",
            "Viele bedeutende Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer fundamentalen Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seinem Gedicht \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" sagt: \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles, was man auf Erden weiß und alles, was man wissen muss.\" Vieles, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht über Bildung oder Erfahrung. Allerdings scheinen wir Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, wie Keats andeutet, ohne in diesen erwarteten Weisen unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind Versuche, zu beschreiben, nicht zu verschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind in der Regel Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literatur schöner ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, nicht eine Reihe von Regeln zur Beurteilung oder Erschaffung guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens. Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann die Essenz des Guten oder Schönen nie vollständig einfangen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von da Vincis Mona Lisa zum Beispiel könnte sich um Begriffe wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Stattdessen ist es üblich, wenn man nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder einer Lieblingsliteratur gefragt wird, eine Phrase wie \"Es gibt einfach etwas daran\" zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Qualitäten reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das nicht auf andere Weise gesagt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Erklärung unzureichend wäre.\" Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt immer etwas Transzendentales. Ich glaube, dass Ethik dieselbe Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: \"Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses 'etwas', diese \"je ne sais quoi\", ist, was den mächtigsten Aspekt von Kunst und Moral ausmacht, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet. Ich glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir sie beide am mächtigsten auf einer noemalen Ebene, im Kant'schen Sinne, erleben. Sie wirken auf einer Ebene, die erlebt werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: \"Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was sie tatsächlich einzigartig macht, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es könnte sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste, wie Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen so relevant für die Literatur wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte. ... Literatur ist uns wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir suchen.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany, as we now know it, comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.). Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premises. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "I stared down, mind blankly comprehending the view before me. Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared. So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at.\nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study. Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.\nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.\nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind's will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.

            "Teenager behind the wheel: the statistics are alarming. Several factors combine to create this deadly trend for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem is that the teenager's brain is not yet ready for the dangers of driving. Inexperience also plays a significant role. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also fare worse when they drive with their peers, which, as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows, happens regularly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that revealed the following correlation: the older the passenger, the fewer traffic accidents occur.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to increase teen driver safety by implementing temporary provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, in my view, these provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The root problem is that, as a group, the youngest drivers, by all statistical measures, are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research has shown that young people under 19-20 frequently engage in risky behavior for the thrill. It makes sense, therefore, to delay driving at least until this tendency has subsided. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we will not only see more deadly accidents but the death toll could skyrocket in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue could be quite straightforward. Schools could continue to teach driver's education to begin the learning process, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, and a certain number of practical driver's training hours would still be required. The specific number of hours could be based on the majority of states' requirements (in California, for example, this is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the deadly statistics for teen drivers are not confined to one state, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and, I believe, effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not a new idea.",
            "In den späten 1890er und frühen 1900er Jahren gab es in der Library of Congress eine Sammlung von frühen Filmen von Edison, insgesamt 15 Filme aus den Jahren 1895 bis 1901. Diese Filme nutzen oft kreative Schnitte, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudien konzentrierten sich darauf, die ästhetischen Merkmale der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionsbiographischen Merkmale in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Trickfilme zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts sind im Allgemeinen in einer festen Kulisse, innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums, gedreht und haben keine Kamerabewegungen, verwenden lange und mittlere Einstellungen und befolgen die strenge Regel, dass ein Schuss gleich einem Film entspricht.\n\nAllerdings gibt es einige Filme am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Regeln brechen, indem sie mehrere Einstellungen einführen. Ein gemeinsames Merkmal, das alle Trickfilme aufweisen, ist, dass sie in einer Innenkulisse innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums gedreht werden. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Proszeniumposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und geht auf das Theater und im speziellen Fall auf Varietéshows und Zauberkunststücke zurück. Eine Einschränkung der Verwendung einer Bühne ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen in der Regel nur von links nach rechts und vice versa wandern und nicht zur Kamera hin oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich hin und her entlang der Horizontalachse. Auch wenn sie den Bildausschnitt verlassen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDie frontale Proszeniumkomposition bedeutet auch, dass die Einstellungen oft lang und seltener mittel sind. Nahaufnahmen gibt es in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog. Dies folgt der Theater- und Varietétradition, in der das Publikum die gesamte Vorstellung zur selben Zeit sieht, die durch die Grenzen der Bühne gerahmt ist. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler auch nicht aus dem Mittelfeld zur Kamera hin, sodass Nahaufnahmen nicht vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Schuss gleich einem Film ist. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von der Anzahl der Bilder pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Varietétats wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschtricks mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Schuss für den Betrachter nicht immer einem physischen Schuss entspricht. Ein einzelner \"Schuss\" kann tatsächlich mehrere sein, die zusammengefügt werden, um den Eindruck von Apperenz oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich genau \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), einen der frühen Trickfilme, an. Eine genauere Untersuchung zeigt den Zeitpunkt, an dem der physische Schuss mit dem abgetrennten \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film für den Betrachter konzeptionell ein einziger Schuss ist.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent proponent of Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, his profession along with his brief political career made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system formed the basis for almost all of his views on government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government. He strongly believed in the natural rights of man and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was man's motivation in all things, but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was somewhat disheartening and the reason for this decline is not entirely clear. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is a noticeable drop in people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which might account for some part of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might have simply slipped off the radar for many people. Additionally, December brings the start of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, and this might also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, none of this really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also speculate that any project of this nature is likely to experience an initial burst of energy and excitement that then naturally declines. In an attempt to fight this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to try and revitalize the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we faced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement and the specific problem of holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to offer incentives for alternative modes of commuting. We offered many prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to counteract that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes did not change significantly during the course of the project. If the prizes had increased in value over time, this might have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start of the project, but announcing a couple of bicycles in December and then a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than decreasing it.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist. For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\nIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dreamland ist eines von Edgar Allan Poes selbst als besser empfundenen Gedichten. In \"Dream-Land\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in Versen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil nutzte diesen Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als das Ende der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil diesen Begriff verwendet hat, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der etwas Anerkennung zusteht. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert.\n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil er Poes Vertrautheit mit den Schriften Goethes zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poe’s Politian und Goethe’s Mignon\", deutet die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitiert haben könnte.\n\nDas Oxford Companion to English Literature beschreibt Goethe als einen berühmten Schriftsteller der lyrischen Dramen,\"Faust\", die in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurden, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr des Todes Goethes, 1832. Im lyrischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Fausts liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thule\". Es handelt sich um einen König, der nach dem Tod seiner Frau, die ihm ein Kelch geschenkt hat, zu trinken beginnt und weint. Er entscheidet dann, dass es an der Zeit ist zu sterben und gibt seine Besitztümer seinen Kindern, behält aber den Kelch. Er geht zu einem Felsen, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Verhalten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich und könnten eine dunkle Kopie von Poes Verlust und seiner Abhängigkeit vom Trinken sein. Faust wurde auch von H.P. Grattan in 1842 in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" lag.\n\nPoe bezieht sich zweimal auf Thule in seinen gesammelten Schriften. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" verwendet er den Begriff \"ultma Thule\", aber er nutzt diesen Ausdruck auch in \"Dream-Land\" als Rahmen des Gedichts. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Dream-Land\" können als companion pieces gelesen werden. Im \"Dream-Land\" beschreibt der Sprecher die Landschaft von Thule als dunkel und einsam, er wird von toten Freunden verfolgt und sieht eine farblose Welt. All diese Szenen könnten in \"Der König von Thule\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat und sich einsam fühlt und seine Willenskraft verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht beschreibt, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre.\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Schriftsteller, den Poe sicherlich gekannt haben musste, allein schon aus Respekt für Tennyson. Als Poe nach seiner Meinung zu Tennyson gefragt wurde, sagte er, dass er ihn neben der Verbindung zu Tennyson auch durch die vielen Nachdrucke, die nach der ersten Veröffentlichung stattfanden, mit Goethes Werken vertraut gemacht wurde.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to clean it up for half an hour because he was having dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim summarily. To claim punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple customers were injured from slipping in the months before her accident, and despite this knowledge, he failed to clean up the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less persuasive but reasonable considering the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the same day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a partial summary motion against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally witnessed the media in America shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam. I don’t think that in 2001 we could have imagined a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who had a clear Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet intrigues me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, it contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From my past knowledge and learning, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a sort of martyr, who was misinterpreted and even humbled himself before others. After which, one by one, people began to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the authors intended Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet, who did not need to prove anything but lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is as if they are trying to steal credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, there are many stories in the biography that seem to serve as proof of ‘witness’ or how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam. However, the problem is that many of these stories are from a third-party perspective. The author illustrates that he heard these stories from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so, and so on. I did not like this approach because, although their intention was to provide proof of the truth of the stories, it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try to exalt and elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think that Muslims today might not know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin. It seems that today's world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the original intent of the religion's namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire. But later, that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So what is it that happened since Jesus' lifetime?\nIf we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that The Jungle illustrates how humans deep down are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only look out for themselves and want to make their lives as good as possible, but they never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The book shows this in many ways. The most obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They don't care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their progress. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They don't care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers also didn't care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Manche Autoren verwenden verschiedene Methoden, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine bestimmte Einstellung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind wirksamer als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald nutzt viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman \"Der große Gatsby\". Manchmal paart er ein Adjektiv und ein Nomen, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und nutzt es dann zu diesem Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In \"Der große Gatsby\" baut Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere für Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet diese Bedeutungen später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl gegenüber einem wichtigen Objekt zu vermitteln.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und nutzt, ist Uniformität, wobei Weiß etwas freundlicher und höherwertiger ist und Grau älter und verflogen. Fitzgerald etabliert diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans durch die wiederholte Verwendung beider Farben. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - in der Tat tragen alle immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellhosen\" (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\" (36), wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"pulverweiß\" (30) gepudert. In Wirklichkeit tragen Menschen nur dann etwas anderes als Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party beschreibt: \"die Korridore... sind bunt mit Primärfarben\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter durch die Farbgebung vieler alltäglicher, unwichtiger Dinge: Als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Abgründe der unteren New York\" (56) hinab, die Namen der Menschen bei Gatsbys Partys sind nun \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, und die Wohnung von Catherine ist \"eine Scheibe in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Appartement-Häusern\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch alltägliche oder unwichtige Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Mädchenzeit\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Länder\" (23) im Tal der Asche, das \"italienische Kind\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26), und der Hundebezügler ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27). Nachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, nutzt er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Uniformität gegenüber bestimmten Themen zu vermitteln. Dies beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne eine signifikante Verwendung von entweder von diesen Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in Weiß\" (74) gekleidet in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\" ; die Leser fangen an, Daisy als weniger als eine Figur, sondern mehr wie eine uniforme Ergänzung zu sehen, etwas, das Gatsby will und nach dem er strebt. Fitzgerald verwendet diese Technik weiter um Daisy herum, um den Eindruck zu verstärken, dass Daisy mehr eine uniforme Ergänzung ist, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Hauch von Daisys Pelzkragen\" (18) und sie trägt wieder ein \"weißes\" (115) Kleid vor dem Treffen mit Tom und Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nA suitable piece of property was selected from a real estate website and available government programs were researched to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Kultur spielt eine wesentliche Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann definiert werden als viel mehr, was sie nicht ist, als das, was sie tatsächlich ist, und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist nicht homogen, noch ist sie eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht einheitlich oder uniform. Aussagen wie “alle Russen sind stur” oder “alle Japaner sind anpassungsfähig” sind in sich selbst gewaltig und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis der allgemeinen Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es für einen Verhandler vielmehr produktiv, die Bedeutung der Kultur im Hinblick auf das Thema und wie die Einstellung der Kultur die Gespräche am Verhandlungstisch beeinflussen kann, zu verstehen. Wenn man eine fremde Kultur trifft, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche sind unvermeidlich.\n\nDas Verständnis einer fremden Kultur oder Mentalität kann alles von der Untersuchung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zum Erkennen ihrer Vorurteile umfassen. Anstatt zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, eine Kultur zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders insbesondere in der Verhandlung, und besonders dann, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch tritt. Ebenso, wenn ein Verhandler sich auf “fremdem” Terrain befindet, kann Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen nur dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass sich Kultur nicht notwendigerweise auf eine nationale/Internationale Zweiteilung beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb einer gegebenen Nation schaffen ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur die Arbeit im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Zeichen einer Unternehmenskultur lassen sich in der Kleidung der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkt vs. indirekt, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungsmethoden erkennen. Einige Unternehmen fördern das Engagement von Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene der Mitarbeiter, während andere es auf “genehmigte” Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen beschränken. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und tatsächlich besteht innerhalb einer Gesellschaft auch innerhalb eines Unternehmens eine große Vielfalt, auch von Region zu Region, einschließlich städtischer und Vorort-Umgebungen) betrachten, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur wohnen können. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht so geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden möglicherweise einheitlicher, aber ein solches Äußeres ist nur ein Zeichen, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind sogar wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den Grundsatz einer Kultur darstellen. Wenn es in einer Kultur darum geht, das Gesicht zu wahren oder Gemeinschaftsharmonie, ist es sicherlich, dass ein Verhandler seinen Arbeitgeber oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich blamieren wird, um am Verhandlungstisch zu triumphieren. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, der ein harter Handeln einen höheren Stellenwert einräumt, nicht unbedingt dazu gedrängt sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einem Abschluss zu kommen. Diese allgemeinen Erkenntnisse sollten berücksichtigt werden, bevor man sich an den Verhandlungstisch begibt. Allerdings ist ein Verhandler gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effizient zu gestalten.",
            "Der Narr sprach in seinem Herzen: „Es gibt keinen Gott.“ Diese Aussage findet sich erstmals in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und erscheint als Einführung in die Argumentation von St. Anselm über das Dasein Gottes. Es scheint, dass auch der andere Autor, den wir diskutieren werden, Thomas Aquinas, diese Überzeugung teilt. Da beide ihre Argumente in der Verteidigung desselben Konzeptes ausführen und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu entscheiden, welches der beiden besser ist, müssen wir, um der Kürze willen, davon ausgehen, dass beide in der Existenz Gottes, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen. Die Annahme eines Gottes, der nicht dem einer ähnlichen Vorstellung entspricht, würde einen adäquaten Vergleich ihrer beiden Argumente nicht zulassen, da sie im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung einer bestimmten Gottesvorstellung beitragen. Es ist zu vermuten, dass beide jeweils wertvolle Punkte ansprechen, aber keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\n\nUm dies zu veranschaulichen, untersucht man zunächst die Grundidee von St. Anselm. Anselms Passage reflektiert einen Weg zur Erkenntnis durch den Glauben und den Blick in das eigene Innere, um Beweise für Gottes Existenz zu finden. Er erklärt, dass, weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, wir ihn nicht effektiv als nichtexistent denken können. Während diese Idee in seiner Terminologie etwas schwerfällig und manchmal unklar ist, besteht das grundlegende Konzept darin, dass die Beweisführung für Gott innerhalb unseres eigenen Geistes liegt. St. Anselm schlägt vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz eines solchen Wesens nur durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir als wahr wissen, in unseren eigenen Geistern gefunden wird. Fremde Beweise sind angeblich nicht notwendig. Diese Idee, die Annahme dessen, für das es keine unumstößliche empirische Evidenz gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee steht im Gegensatz zu der von St. Thomas Aquinas vertretenen. Thomas stattet die Existenz Gottes durch pure Vernunft und empirische Beweise aus, ohne dass der Glaube eine Rolle spielt. Eine solche Idee wäre vorteilhaft für die Missionierung, einem wichtigen Aspekt des Christentums, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Convertiten ermöglichen würde, ohne von deren Bereitschaft abhängig zu sein, etwas Unbewiesenes anzunehmen. Stattdessen könnten sie durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas führt fünf verschiedene logische Argumente zur Unterstützung der Gottesexistenz vor: Veränderung, Ursache, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem Fall zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gottes Existenz in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn dir erklärt wird, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du die anderen Teile zusammensetzt, so zwingt dich die Logik, die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Puzzleteils zu kennen, ohne es sehen zu müssen.",
            "Einmal im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages als Buddha bekannt sein würde. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er die Welt auf und erlangte die Erleuchtung, und seine Lehren führten zur Gründung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Dies ist in vielen Bereichen ersichtlich, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasserritual gefeiert wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen daran teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gesprochen hat. Diese Unterschiede erstrecken sich von oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zu den soteriologischen Grundlagen der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinde, sowohl aus der monastischen Perspektive als auch aus der der Laien, hat im Laufe der Zeit ihre doctrinalen Prinzipien ändern müssen. Dies ist sowohl auf äußere als auch auf innere Einflüsse, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende zurückzuführen.\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Begriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Dazu gehört der Begriff von inneren versus äußeren Kräften. Hier wird eine innere Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasana stammt, unabhängig von deren monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder ihr schaden will – eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft nicht schaden will, die jedoch möglicherweise doch schaden kann oder auch hilft – sei es als Nebenwirkung. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet.\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Zentrum des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Dreifachjuwel des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den drei Körben – dem Tripitaka – der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Sutras, der Vinaya Pitaka die disziplinären Regeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Konzepte umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – das inhärente Leiden im Leben und Anicca – die Unbeständigkeit alles. Erst durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der unablässig ist. Mit dem Ende von Sansara endet auch Lobha – Begierde, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Verblendung, wenn man erleuchtet ist. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden die Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde nicht unkeusch sein und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinäre Regeln zu befolgen. Die fundamentale doctrinale Idee im Buddhismus ist die Lehre der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that at one time were burdened by a long-lasting rivalry that endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The height of this rivalry was marked by the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, and these tensions gradually subsided just before the First World War. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as major conflicts of material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is not uncommon for neighboring nations, which often have conflicting interests that lead to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are not unique in this regard. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals, while other Latin American nations have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues have created a rift between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similarly, the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests considered vital by each nation. In this case, however, the ideological disputes were rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust was inherited from the distrust between the English and Spanish. These feelings of distrust, carried over from their colonial rulers, posed a significant obstacle to the establishment of friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. The majority of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a major issue that persisted until both the United States and Mexico enforced military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security that I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a little of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, here I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call my own. I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D’Arcy Thompson stated that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes (i.e. builds) its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Since 2012, Indonesia has seen little change in neonatal and infant mortality rates. Despite progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, improvements in child and maternal health have fallen short of the 2015 goals. We will explore the reasons for this below, pointing to a need to bolster the health system rather than focus on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has increased the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers to 72%, but this still includes traditional birth attendants like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions for complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. Improvements in this area are misleading, and there's still much to do. Additionally, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrhea by healthcare professionals has decreased.\n\nData on postnatal care is incomplete, but it's clear that this area is also problematic with low rates nationwide. C-section rates are still low, at around 4%, with urban areas seeing 7% and rural areas 2%. This highlights equity issues, as access to healthcare services is primarily in urban areas. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access care due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen planning next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or strengthen the overall health system? Programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable objectives and quicker results. However, they can lead to funding shortages and human resource imbalances, with programs attracting more resources. Additionally, parallel programs for one area can result in service duplication and uncoordinated efforts, leading to increased paperwork and bureaucracy.",
            "Victorian Romane zeichnen sich durch ihre ausführliche Detailgenauigkeit und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der damaligen Zeit aus. Zwei Romane, die von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Werke nutzen ein Element des Mystery und eine Vorliebe für das Absonderliche, was für die damaligen Romane untypisch ist und die Charaktere in jedem Werk stärken; sie bieten Einblicke in ihre Motive und Emotionen.\n\n“Und nun drängten sich unzählige verwirrende und verwirrende Ideen in seinen Geist. Es schien, als ob er noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit ginge, die sich wütend stritten; denn die Worte, die sie sagten, hallten in seinen Ohren wider; und als er seine Aufmerksamkeit wieder auf sich selbst lenkte, … fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich zuckte er zusammen, als er den Schuss hörte; und aus der Luft erhoben sich laute Schreie und Rufe; Lichter blitzten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Chaos, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilig fortschleppte. Durch all diese raschen Visionen zog ein unbestimmtes, unruhiges Bewusstsein für den Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich quälte.\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen diese Mystery oft durch Träume oder träumerische Zustände, wobei der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variiert. In Oliver Twist offenbaren diese eigenartigen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn quält und seine Erkenntnisse über die wahre Natur der um ihn herum geschehenen Dinge. Als die Schießerei in Kapitel 28 wieder aufgerufen wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft, als ob er träumte, während er verzweifelt nach Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont Olivers fehlende Kontrolle über die Ereignisse, die sich abspielten, sowie die bedenkliche Lage seiner Gesundheit, die durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit stark präsent ist. Die Schießerei überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, er bemerkt die “unsichtbare Hand” nicht, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seinen Schmerz wieder, entfernt von der Überraschung des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun ständig und mit Angst verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück verursachte, da es sicher nicht sein eigenes war. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver über nichts Kontrolle hat, und kann sich nicht einmal bemühen, die Kontrolle über das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu erlangen, nicht einmal, wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch durch diesen Abschnitt angedeutet, als ob alter Fagin ihn brechen würde, indem er ihn dazu bringt, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren, was seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, beeinflusst. Andernfalls könnte man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest einen Versuch unternommen hätte, zumindest um seines eigenen Lebens willen.\n\nDer Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war gekommen und gegangen, so schnell wie der nächste kam; und die Nacht brach wieder herein; eine lange, lange Nacht und doch so kurz; lang in ihrer schrecklichen Stille und kurz in ihrem fluchtartigen Vergehen.” (Dickens, 220)",
            "Ein paar Jahre ago, arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, bei dem ich Elementarschüler unterrichtete. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in ihren jeweiligen Fächern zu helfen, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englisch- und Lesenunterricht. Eine der Lehrerinnen rekrutierte mich, um einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen, der große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen hatte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse). Es wurde mir schnell klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere nicht einmal annähernd. Du weißt, er war Lateinamerikaner und sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir kämpften uns weiter, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich war gerade dabei, ein paar Kinder zu betreuen, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr geringen Spanischkenntnissen (ich hatte gerade erst angefangen, es zu lernen) kamen wir irgendwie miteinander aus. Es war dann, als mir der Groschen fiel: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur die englischen Buchstaben nicht richtig. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Einsicht ihm wirklich viel half, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser dran ist.\n\nDiese Geschichte erzähle ich, um auf das Problem des Sprachbarrieren in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, aufmerksam zu machen. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, alle können zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also: Was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Nachhilfe im Englischlesen, besonders im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Die duale Sprachsystem, der Mainstreamansatz, private Nachhilfe, ESL-Klassen – keine dieser Methoden, für sich allein, wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, alle diese Ansätze zu kombinieren!\n\nZuerst einmal ist das duale Sprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungseinrichtungen haben sich akademisch besser entwickelt als ihre Mitschüler“, heißt es. Es gibt viele Ängste, dass dies eine Ressourceverschwendung sei und dass die meisten Kinder in den Schulen keine Vorteile davon hätten. Aber das ist nicht wahr. Wenn wir solche Programme in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, statt als Ausnahme, anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir vor? Müssen wir alle Lehrer bilingual sein? Nein, das wäre unrealistisch und unvernünftig. Aber ich denke, es gibt keinen Grund, warum wir nicht spezialisierte Helfer, Tutor*innen oder wie man sie auch nennen möchte, haben könnten, die bilingual sind.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too. He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define. What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have begun to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as:\n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",
            "Die Lieferkettenverwaltung ist der Fluss von Prozessen, die die Waren von der Kundenbestellung über die Rohstoffphase, Versorgung, Produktion und Verteilung von Produkten an den Kunden bringt. Der Begriff \"Supply Chain Management\" wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Umsetzung und Steuerung dessen, was auf der Lieferkette passiert, um Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu befriedigen. Es gibt sechs wesentliche Elemente in einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsmanager nutzen diese sechs wesentlichen Elemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Sie bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles hergestellt wird. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Um dies zu erfahren, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator dafür, was die Kunden nachfragen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und in welcher Menge. Nach der Entscheidung, was produziert und in welcher Menge hergestellt werden soll, sind die Manager bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welche Fabrik am besten für die Volumen- und Qualitätsanforderungen geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenbedürfnisse und -zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen. Sobald der Produktionsort festgelegt ist, konzentrieren sich die Manager auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Wartung der Geräte. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist entscheidend im gesamten Prozess. Wenn jedes Detail nicht ordnungsgemäß geplant wird, kann dies dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben für jede Geschäftseinheit ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess. Es gibt eine vorgegebene Anordnung, wie eine Mitarbeiteruniform aussehen soll, bis hin zum Empfang von LKW-Lieferungen. Diese festgelegten Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über die Richtung und Erwartungen.",
            "Hitler lives in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard high above her head. The unsettling message is written on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, there were several street protests, the first public protests in a decade. Led by many Burmese monks, these protests were known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial unrest, the public became more involved, and while the government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, violence escalated into what some considered a full-scale war between the monks and the military junta. The military attacked and looted monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, said, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. Governments' desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over their citizens has existed since the dawn of civilization. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to rule every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to be gods sent to lead their people to prosperity through inventions like Motorola cell phones and seppuku. Our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nWell-known examples of these actions include the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the authoritarian government. The death toll varies widely, with official Chinese government reports stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s is another example, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich,' a period spanning several years and countries where people of Jewish background were rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",

Er hat den Rahmen geschaffen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, und gleichzeitig eng orchestrierte Stücke und Phrasen geschrieben, die auf den speziellen Stil der Bandmitglieder verwiesen, um musikalische Ideen zu unterstreichen. Auf diese Weise hat er auch den Klang des Orchesters insgesamt betont und originale, zusammenhängende Klänge für jedes Stück geschaffen. Ellingtons Meisterschaft über die individuellen Klänge der Spieler sowie deren Zusammenwirken in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Lexikon beschreibt in Bezug auf Ellingtons Klang und Innovation die \"Creole Love Call\" als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme als \"Jazz-Instrument\" in seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Fähigkeit, die Stimme einzusetzen, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne den Lyrikschranken zu unterliegen. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere hindurch zeigen lässt. Dieses langsame, gezielte bluesige Zwölftaktstück besteht aus sechs Chorussen, wie folgt:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und gegen Ende rauer wird.\n\nChorus 2: Muted Trumpet Solo, das die Grundmelodie ausführt und mehrere verlängerte Bluesnoten betont.\n\nChorus 3: Weitreichender Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, begleitet von einer subtilen synkopierten Klavierphrase.\n\nChorus 4: Volles Orchester wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call and response durch die Blech- und Holzbläserabteilungen.\n\nChorus 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stücks, bei dem die Holzbläser den Call and response in einem hohen Register beginnen, begleitet von synkopiertem Stop-Time von den Blech- und Rhythmusabteilungen.\n\nChorus 6: Zurück zur Struktur des ersten Choruses mit Call and response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus nimmt die Stimme den \"Growl\"-Klang an und spielt wie ein Instrument solo.\n\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einer Vocalrun und einem unkonventionellen dissonanten Trompetensolo-Ende.\n\nEllingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine zusätzliche Dimension von Tonfarbe zu verleihen, ist ein Beispiel für eine stilistische Eigenart, die sich durch seine gesamte Werkstatt durchzieht. In \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeiten in der engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für die Tonfarbe. Ein Call and response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley am muted Trumpet und Baby Cox' Scat-Singen nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley's Spiel und instrumentale Aspekte von Cox' Stimme, um einen reichen und ergänzenden Klang zu schaffen. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" führt diese Ideen weiter, indem Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine ständige Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf muted Trompete einzuführen.",
            "She had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat), and fish, while also featuring lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have reported an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies, however, did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If records were not available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified accordingly. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America experienced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most influential corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so we must ask the following questions: how did this crisis come about, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to grant sub-prime loans to an already immature and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves with inadequate capital reserves and transferred the resulting chaos to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and ultimately to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President was seeking a second term in office. To achieve this goal, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would follow seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMany factors combined to plunge the economy into chaos, one of which was the new and complex mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general becoming overleveraged in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, die Einführung! Dieser Punkt in deiner Geschichte, an dem du deine kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausstreckst und die Welt mit deinem magnetischen, ja zauberhaftem Prosa-Geschwurbel begeisterst. Oder der Teil, bei dem deine Leser einschlafen und/oder auf \"Zurück\" klicken, während sie deinen Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, dass sie an ihrem Monitor schreit, wenn sie sich in der Mitte von Too Much Information wiederfindet, und das nicht auf die gute Weise.\n\nDie Einführung ist dein Feind.\n\nDeine lieben Leser kennen bereits die grundlegende Schreibregel \"Show, don't tell\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch über lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert, oder noch schlimmer, zu viel. Die Einführung ist der kleine Teufel auf deiner Schulter, der dir sagt, dass du die Geschichte aus dem Weg schaffen sollst, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der dich dazu drängt, deinem Publikum jede Einzelheit aus den Kindertagen jedes Charakters zu erzählen).\n\nDie Einführung bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Sprache. Im Film findet die Einführung statt, wenn eine Figur der anderen eine Informationsspritze verpasst, wie in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". In der Fiktion tut das der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist hier angebracht. Wenn du eine Geschichte liest und erfährst, dass die Heldin ihren geliebten Partner an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie in einer prunkvollen Weise geheiratet haben und dass ihr Mann ihr vor den Augen getötet wurde, würdest du nicht erwarten, dass diese entire Sequenz zwei Seiten in Anspruch nimmt, während beide nur zwei Zeilen haben. Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor Zeit in die Charakterentwicklung des Ehemanns investiert, indem er durch seine Sprache und seinen Stil zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest ebenfalls erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Gesten zeigt, wie sehr das Vorhandensein ihres Lebens in ihrem Leben zu Veränderungen und Bereicherung geführt hat (vor allem, wenn die Geschichte dir später direkt erzählt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine angemessene Einführung in den Ehemann würde dir ermöglichen, emotional in sein Schicksal involviert zu sein und Einblicke in die Charaktere der Heldin zu gewinnen: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, reflektiert durch den Spiegel seiner Augen, und so weiter. Du würdest seinen Tod mit ihr trauern und dich so enger mit der Heldin selbst verbinden.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass du dem simplem Knochen der Handlung Fleisch hinzufügst: \"Sie trafen sich, heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller musst du das Fleisch liefern. (*schaut auf das Metaphern, seufzt, setzt seinen Weg fort*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, bestimmte Dinge zu übergehen. Vielleicht führst du einen neuen Charakter ein und weißt, dass er früher in der Air Force war, jetzt Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zwei Mal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, am Wochenende gerne fischen geht, im Geheimen davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und am Morgen Eier Benedict hatte.",
            "Ich habe zwei Nachrichtenberichte aus Columbus, Ohio gesehen. Der erste Bericht, der live war, kam von NBC 4 heute Morgen (August 13, 2011). Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name war Shad Hostettler, und es wurde kein Name der Frau genannt. Sie zeigten sein Foto und er sah aus wie der pure Böse. Sie widmeten diesem Bericht etwa zwei Minuten, da die Entwicklung noch im Gange war. Die einzigen Details, die sie gaben, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und verhaftet worden war. Ich denke, sie haben diesem Bericht eine angemessene Zeit gewidmet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem frühen Morgen-Schuss auf Travis Buyers, 18 Jahre alt. Er wurde in der Sharon Woods Area angeschossen und war in kritischem Zustand; es gab zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team untersuchte den Vorfall. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das könnte daran gelegen haben, dass es sich um einen \"schwarzen\" Mann oder eine \"schwarze\" Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe (und das schon seit Jahren) bemerkt, dass Minderheiten bei einem Verbrechen oft übersehen werden. Wenn zum Beispiel ein \"weißes\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder ein Opfer eines Verbrechens ist, wird die Medienwelt verrückt; aber wenn es sich um eine Minderheit handelt, ist es froh, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Einschussloch, das in einem Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden wurde. Details dazu, wo der Vorfall passiert sein könnte, wurden gegeben. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr gehandelt hatte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten für Hinweise, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen, eine Belohnung von 5.000 Dollar an.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Einbruch in einen UDF an Clime Road in Columbus. Es wurde gesagt, dass es sich um einen Mann mit dunkler Hautfarbe handelte, der den Laden überfallen hatte. Er trug einen Hoodie-Sweatshirt und war etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wog etwa 68 Kilogramm. Ich fand es ungewöhnlich, dass sie so viel Zeit damit verbrachten, zu betonen, dass er schwarz ist und wie dunkel er ist.\n\nEin weiterer Bericht handelte von einem Rene Rodriguez, der als texanischer Drogenboss verhaftet worden war. Er war wegen des Versuchs, Marihuana in großen Mengen von Texas nach Ohio zu verteilen, verurteilt worden. Ein merkwürdiger Punkt, den ich bemerkte, war, dass sie anstatt zu sagen, dass er 25 Jahre Gefängnis bekommen hatte, sagten \"300\" Monate. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was dahintersteckte, ob sie dachten, das klang härter oder was. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann war, ich denke, das war nicht wirklich relevant für die Geschichte.",
            "Es gibt eine tiefe Verbindung zwischen Brüdern; eine unauflösliche, unaufhebbares Band. In dieser Verbindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen sich, weit mehr als jemand anderes mit einer solchen Verbindung, und sie sehen sich selbst nur in ihrem Bruder. Es ist in den scheinbar aussichtslosesten Situationen, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Gefühle sich zeigen, tragen sie eine hohe Kosten. Ein Teil des Verstehens der Gefühle, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung entstehen, besteht darin, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn jemand seinem Bruder in die Augen sieht, erkennt er sich selbst darin nicht so, wie andere ihn sehen, sondern so, wie er wirklich ist. In seinen Taten und den Konsequenzen dieser Taten liegt seine wahre Charakter. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die wilden Emotionen, die damit verbunden sind. Durch eine üppige, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft setzen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert mit intensiver Stolz in der entscheidenden Szene, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihren Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Sicht des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum kommuniziert, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen einwirken.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf eine einzige Gefühl zurückführen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, das erste Mal zusammen unterwegs sind, bis zu ihrer letzten, tragischen Expedition, empfindet der Protagonist Ressentiment gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, den er alle seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten lehren könnte, wie \"… Luft anzuhalten, laufen, springen oder auf den Ranken im Old Woman Swamp klettern…\". Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle eines \"…jemandem zu dem man bis Horsehead Landing rennt…und jemandem, mit dem man auf der oberen Gabelung des großen Pins hinter dem Scheune sitzt…\" einnehmen könnte. Offensichtlich sind solche Dinge unmöglich, da Doodle mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren wurde, was seine Überlebenschancen stark mindert. Und selbst wenn es fast unmöglich wäre, dass er je anstrengende körperliche Aktivitäten ausübt. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilden Fantasien ist, dass all diese Träume so schnell zerschlagen werden. Tatsächlich wird gezeigt, dass er sogar eine gewisse Wut auf das kleine Kind hat, als er daran denkt, ihn durch Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu töten. Welcher Kind hätte die Geistesgegenwart, um Infanticide in Betracht zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so simple Handlung kann dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung geben! Das zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark ist. In seinem Hinterkopf hat er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.",
            "The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind as you learn about the brain that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions. Information processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple information like color, orientation, and object borders, where color changes significantly over a short space, to recognize it as a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made at some steps in the bottom-up process to speed up recognition. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background. Once information has been processed to a certain degree, an attention filter determines its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For instance, even though your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name even if spoken in a noisy room. There are many processing stages, and processing results are modulated by attention repeatedly. For the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded, with different encoding types for each sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons for a short period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins. There are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are concept nodes and that these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley kritisiert in \"Brave New World\" die aufkommende Bedrohung durch Technologie und die kapitalistische Struktur, die diese stärkt, indem sie eine dystopische Gesellschaft schafft. In dieser Gesellschaft wird Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen gestellt, und die Menschen werden von Anfang an so konditioniert, dass sie das Streben nach sofortiger Glückseligkeit über alles andere stellen. Die Bürger werden als Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die in einer Ideologie leben, die vom World Controller vorgegeben wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes mit marxistischen Augenwinkeln wird die heimliche Skepsis des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung dieser Systeme deutlich. Begriffe wie Homogenität und Reifikation aus der Marxismus unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Fehlern der aufstrebenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch die Marxistische These der falschen Bewusstsein kritisiert. Die Normalbürger werden daran gehindert, die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen zu erkennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihrem eigenen Vorteil interessiert sind. Dies ist das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle der Proletarier und der einfachen Arbeiter, was in der Conditionierung der Menschen im Brave New World deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, wie Delta und Gamma, haben keinen wahren eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Antrieb zu Konsum, Ausgeben und Indulgen gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass soziale Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen total dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall deutlich. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst, sie \"kaufen\" quasi eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (also Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Möglichkeit geboren, dies zu erkennen, tun aber nichts; selbst Alphas oder Betas wie Bernard tun wenig mehr, als ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie weiter ausgeführt wird, bedeutsame Indikationen der wahrgenommenen Kapitalismusoppression.\n\nIn Brave New World gibt es keine Beziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen. Der Roman scheint sich weigern, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden; selbst bei den Hauptfiguren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley damit sagen, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen dem Menschen die Freiheit und Ausdrucksmöglichkeit nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme irgendeines Gefühls; Interaktionen bleiben oberflächlich, dargestellt durch die Kommentare der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf deren körperliche Attraktivität beziehen, und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen. Zudem zeigt die allgemeine Zufriedenheit der gesellschaftlichen Schichten mit ihrem Platz im Hierarchie den sozioökonomischen Einfluss des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Unterordnung in der Gemeinschaft zeigt den Marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat wider, das sich selbst einen falschen Überlegenheitsgefühl geben lässt, solange es weiter konsumiert, sich unterordnet und in der Spur der Gleichaltrigen bleibt.",
            "Ich habe in diesem Semester etwa zwei Jahre und vierzehn Monate studiert, das sind auch vier und ein halbes Semester. Für viele, einschließlich mir, ist es schwierig, sich auf dem Campus zu bewegen. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls Wohnheim untergebracht; das ist im Wesentlichen der östlichste Punkt des Campus, ausgenommen das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center. Der Weg von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu meinen Vorlesungen in so weit entfernten Gebäuden wie dem Willard Building, das sich in der Mitte des Campus befindet, konnte bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders bei schlechter Witterung, wie sie häufig in State College vorkommt. Ein Absolvent, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erzählte mir, dass die East Halls Wohnheime nicht lange her von einem großen ungenutzten Landstück getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportplätzen, neuen Gebäuden wie dem neuen Creamery und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstgebäude gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Während unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es schwieriger und schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Welche ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Ein Fahrrad allein wird jedoch keine Probleme lösen. Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch unterhielt mich mit einem Freund, der erst kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder mit dem Fahrradfahren angefangen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragt, warum er jemals aufgehört hat. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „ein paar Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben der Tatsache, dass es gut für den Körper ist, ist Radfahren die effizienteste Art zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung können dich 30 Meilen oder mehr bringen. Wie viele andere Erstsemester lebe auch ich abseits des Campus, genau so weit weg von der Campusmitte wie einige Wohnheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Vorlesungen im Thomas Building, das etwa 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit einem Fahrrad kann man diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn man schnell pedalt. Das Problem ist nur, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas Building von meinem Haus aus ist, und es ist nicht immer leicht, diese Straße zu befahren, egal ob mit oder ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt auch Vieles zu sagen für das Gehen, aber ich bin zu beschäftigt, um zu gehen. Wenn ich mein Fahrrad nicht hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Möglichkeit, zum Unterricht zu kommen. Ein tägliches Gehen zum Thomas Building würde mir extra 30-40 Minuten meines Tages kosten. Das sind über zwei und ein halbes Stunden pro Woche. Hinzu kommt all die Zeit, die ich für den Weg zu und vom Unterricht, zu Terminen und so weiter aufwenden müsste. Das ist zu viel Zeit, die ich nicht erübrigen kann."
