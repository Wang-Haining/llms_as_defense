            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a vital role in every negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually is and represents. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a specific thing. It is also not uniform or standardized. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently too general and overly simplified. While understanding cultural generalizations has its place, it is more productive for a negotiator to understand the relevance of a culture to the current situation and how that culture's attitudes can and will influence the discussions. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in relation to one's own culture, and comparisons inevitably arise.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve everything from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must accept it for what it is and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations, and particularly when coming to the table from a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when a negotiator finds themselves in foreign territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can only help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Most companies within a nation develop their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize extended working hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture manifests in dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, task delegation), and recruitment practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to company-approved charities or fundraisers. The variations in American corporate culture from company to company (including regional differences and urban-suburban distinctions) demonstrate the diversity of thought possible within a particular societal culture. Some cultures may appear more uniform than American culture to outsiders, but similar appearances often indicate a need to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly crucial to understand as they reveal the underlying motivations of a culture. In cultures that prioritize saving face or community harmony, a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed at negotiations. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't necessarily rush to reach an agreement. While considering these general principles is important before negotiations begin, a negotiator benefits from understanding their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiation.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart: 'There is no God.'\" This quotation first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and stands at the beginning of St. Anselm's argumentation regarding God's existence. This conviction appears to be shared by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Since their arguments both address the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, proceed from their shared correct belief in God's existence, specifically the God of the Bible. To consider a god-like figure that might not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not allow us to properly compare their arguments, as they are essentially defending one specific conception of God. With this in mind, I would propose that while both present valid points, neither provides a truly comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, let us first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a journey of gaining understanding through faith, looking inward to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, expressed in his terminology, is somewhat cumbersome and occasionally unclear, the essential message is that proof of God resides within one's own mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own soul to find truth about God; rather, His existence is proven simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. External evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is no irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to in Christian texts as faith.\n\nThis approach differs markedly from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead proposes that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. Such an approach would be advantageous in evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without depending on their willingness to accept unprovable assertions. They could instead be convinced through pure logic. St. Thomas develops five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially demonstrates that proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God's existence. It's like being told you're missing one puzzle piece and assembling the rest - logic allows you to know the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers regarding important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs many of these different techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" At times, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject for his readers. In other instances, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald applies this latter technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald constructs meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later employs these meanings to evoke specific emotional associations with important objects in readers' minds.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald establishes and uses for white/gray represents uniformity, with white suggesting a more refined and upper-class quality, while gray indicates something more aged and faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the novel's beginning through consistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" - indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick in his \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom in his \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine \"powdered milky white.\" The only exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to common, unremarkable elements: Nick travels through \"white chasms of lower New York,\" the names at Gatsby's parties become \"gray names,\" and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - all suggesting uniformity.",
            "San Diego County demonstrates remarkable agricultural productivity, owing to its mild, sun-rich climate. The region produces a diverse array of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, fruit trees such as peach and lemon, berries, honey, and peppers. The San Diego area features a robust market for organic community-supported agriculture, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and dairy products enjoy significant popularity. Many organic farms extend their offerings beyond agriculture, providing guided tours of their operations and allowing access for hiking, bird watching, and various recreational pursuits. This operational model enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat quality, facilitating recreational use, and creating revenue opportunities through farm tours and educational programs.\n\nBeyond serving a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming typically promotes greater biodiversity in both flora and fauna due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, organic farming does present certain increased costs compared to conventional methods. It demands more intensive labor and management for pest control, weed removal, and natural soil fertilization, often experiencing higher crop losses than conventional farming, while small organic operations lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, though not strictly tied to organic farming, may incur extra labor costs, including cover crop cultivation, planned grazing rotation, invasive species management, and deliberate vegetation management to create specific habitat features like edge environments or open ground areas. These factors explain why landowners might seek financial assistance or expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario comprises 160 acres adjacent to Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, featuring chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, currently under review, encompasses over a hundred plant and animal species, including endangered species like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as potentially soon-to-be-listed species such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis land carries a rich history, having been home to Native American peoples for centuries before transitioning to cattle ranching and firewood production in the late 1800s. Originally established through a homestead patent, the property likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. The property was identified through real estate listings, with subsequent research into available government programs to explore realistic options for small farmers interested in cost mitigation and wildlife conservation. A local organic farm serves as a model for potential agricultural approaches on this land.",
            "There exists a connection between brothers - an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within this connection lie numerous emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name but a few. Brothers understand each other on a level that surpasses any other relationship of this kind, and they can truly see themselves only when looking at their brother. It is during the most desperate situations that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether for good or ill. When these emotions surface, they bring with them a hefty price. Understanding the emotions that stem from this fraternal connection means confronting their consequences. When one looks into a brother's eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their genuine character manifests in their actions and the consequences thereof.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme and all the turbulent emotions that accompany it. Against a richly detailed, vibrant backdrop, these two boys embark on what proves to be a futile journey. In the story's climactic moment, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, their interactions, and through the narrator's perspective, which conveys both the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his worldview - both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be traced back to a single driving emotion: pride. From his first outings with his younger brother Doodle until their final, fatal encounter, the protagonist harbors resentment toward Doodle. He had yearned for a brother he could teach his worldly skills to, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted someone to \"race to Horsehead Landing\" and \"perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn.\" Given Doodle's condition, these activities were clearly impossible. Doodle was born with a severely weak heart, making his survival doubtful, let alone participation in strenuous physical activities. What a crushing disappointment for the young protagonist, whose head was filled with wild dreams, to have them shattered in an instant. His anger toward the small child even manifested in thoughts of suffocation with a pillow - a disturbing consideration for a child. Yet, when the small child smiled at him, his heart softened. Such a simple gesture gave the protagonist such hope, suggesting his darker impulses weren't deeply rooted. Deep down, he possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate, creative information processing system. As technology progressed from primitive to modern forms, the metaphors used to describe the brain evolved accordingly. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a papyrus scroll, then to a book, and most recently to a computer. When studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limited utility and can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries - where colors change significantly across short distances - to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions made during bottom-up processing to accelerate your recognition of the box, helping you identify it as a solid black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. While your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your feet, a properly functioning attention filter prevents you from consciously noting each one. Conversely, you might detect your name being called even in a crowded, noisy environment. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nInformation storage precedes processing in the brain. Several memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is first encoded, with different encoding methods for various sensory inputs. Verbal information, for example, can be encoded structurally (appearance of written words), phonemically (sound of words), or semantically (meaning of words). Stored information must then be maintained. Research with animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, operates through electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits. Long-term memory storage is believed to involve structural changes in certain proteins.\n\nMultiple models exist to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval studies, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which in turn links to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most significant corporations were left in ruins. This recession's effects continue to be felt today, prompting us to examine how this crisis occurred and how we can prevent similar situations in the future. In essence, the financial crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed banks and firms to issue subprime loans within an already inadequate financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves, spreading this turmoil throughout the repackaged mortgages they had sold and into the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis had its origins in 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought re-election by boosting his popularity. The Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, Fannie Mae, the nation's leading mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage accessibility to low and moderate-income borrowers while simultaneously satisfying shareholders' demands for continued profit growth. Holmes presciently warned that this government-subsidized corporation might face difficulties during an economic downturn, potentially requiring government intervention similar to the savings and loan industry rescue in the 1980s.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of complex mortgage structures. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years deeply entangled various economic sectors with the housing market. This led American households and financial markets to become overly invested in housing, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing approximately 30% of U.S. GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's forced conversion to commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That moment in your story where you spread your little writer's wings and take off, aiming to impress everyone with your captivating, indeed magical prose. Or it's the part where your readers fall asleep and/or click the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known for yelling at her screen when she finds herself drowning in too much information, and not even in the entertaining way.\n\nExposition isn't your ally.\n\nWhile our dear readers are familiar with the fundamental writing principle \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still catches herself writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or worse, too much happens. Exposition is like that little devil perched on your shoulder, suggesting you get all the background information out of the way to reach the good parts (not to be confused with that other devil on your opposite shoulder, urging you to share every minute detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially telling your audience what occurred, typically through straightforward prose. In films, exposition happens when one character downloads a heap of information onto another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. When reading a story, you might be told about how the heroine met her beloved, their grand wedding, and his subsequent murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only two lines of dialogue each. Instead, you'd expect the author to develop the husband's character, revealing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife, while showing through various means how his presence transformed and enriched her life. A proper character introduction would allow readers to form an emotional connection to his fate while gaining insight into the heroine's character: what attracted her to him, the depth of their bond, and glimpses of her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his perspective. You would share in her grief at his loss, thereby forming a stronger connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance beyond the basic plot points of \"They met, they married, he died.\"",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story concerned a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. While her name wasn't disclosed, he was identified as Shad Hostettler. They showed his police photograph, and he had an absolutely sinister appearance. They dedicated only about two minutes to this developing story. The only details provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I believe they allocated an appropriate amount of time to this story.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, age 18. He was critically wounded in the Sharon Woods area, with no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was conducting the investigation. The coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might have been related to the victim being African-American or the incident occurring in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed over the years that minority victims often receive minimal coverage. When a white person, whether child or adult, becomes a victim of crime or goes missing, the media provides extensive coverage; minority victims, however, often barely receive mention.\n\nThe subsequent story detailed a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided information about the suspected location of the incident. Investigators determined it was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nFollowing this was a weather report predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures expected to remain in the low to mid-eighties. Though brief, this appeared to be used as a teaser to maintain viewership.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall and weighing around one hundred fifty pounds. The coverage seemed to place unusual emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone.\n\nThe final story concerned Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than twenty-five years, perhaps to make it sound more severe. They also mentioned his Hispanic ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. While these advantages are highly attractive, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as having to pay trading commissions on ETF transactions, just as with stocks. Another advantage is the wide range of available ETF options. Although these benefits are clearly outlined, prudent financial investors should always evaluate whether claimed benefits, such as diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the single ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten individual stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nTo make the evaluation manageable, we've chosen to focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The top 10 holdings and their respective asset percentages are listed below.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we can normalize their asset percentages to 100% and calculate each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the complete ETF. These initial findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower risk. However, we must consider whether these differences in means are statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance between these portfolios, we calculated the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalized to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. The onset of winter at a New England campus naturally leads to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which might explain part of this decline. December coincides with the fall semester's conclusion, when everyone is overwhelmed with completing coursework, processing grades, and other end-of-term responsibilities. Many people may have simply forgotten about submitting their commuter logs during this busy time. Moreover, December brings the holiday season and its accompanying month-long break for students and faculty, during which many have no reason to visit campus at all. When classes resume in late January, this might also explain the low submission numbers for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for February's low submission rate. One could theorize that such projects typically experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a focused campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. Thus, we faced the dual challenge of maintaining project momentum against both natural engagement decline and the specific interruptions caused by academic breaks and holidays.\n\nA fundamental challenge for this project (and any alternative transportation initiative) lies in people's deep-seated attachment to the freedom, independence, and flexibility that personal vehicles provide. This is fundamentally woven into our cultural fabric. Consequently, providing compelling incentives for alternative commuting becomes crucial. While we distributed numerous prizes including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage services, independent bookstores, and national retailers, it would have been interesting to explore the impact of more substantial rewards – such as a premium bicycle, hybrid vehicle, or electric car. Such prizes might have helped prevent the participation decline we experienced. Since our prize structure remained constant throughout the project, implementing escalating prize values might have proved beneficial. While the initial gift cards seemed sufficient at the project's start, announcing more substantial prizes like bicycles in December and perhaps a hybrid or electric car in January might have sustained or even increased participation rather than seeing it decline.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I reviewed all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employ creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the common artistic elements found in most trick films while also exploring the unique evolutionary characteristics that emerged in some later works. Generally speaking, trick films at the turn of the century were characterized by set-based filming, frontal proscenium composition, stationary camera work, long and medium shots, and adherence to the principle of one shot equaling one complete film. However, some productions from the early twentieth century began challenging these conventions by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films is their interior set filming within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera maintains a fixed position rather than following the movement of people or objects. This compositional approach, deeply rooted in theatrical traditions and particularly influenced by vaudeville and magic performances, was widespread in early cinema. The stage-based format resulted in characters typically moving only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally across the frame, with the camera remaining stationary even when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. None of the Edison catalog's trick films employed close-up shots, reflecting the theatrical viewing experience where audiences observed the entire stage performance within the confines of the proscenium arch. As was typical in early cinema, performers stayed in the middle ground, never approaching the camera for close-up effects.\n\nMost early trick films followed the convention of one conceptual shot comprising the entire film. This approach limited most productions to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frame rate, and restricted their narrative scope. The majority featured brief vaudeville-style illusions, such as magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that what appears as one continuous shot to viewers often consisted of multiple physical shots cleverly joined to create illusions. This is evident in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the splice point where the shot of Mary's \"decapitation\" was inserted, though the film appears as one continuous take to the casual viewer.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" represents, both in substance and name, an \"oxymoron of 'Old-New'\" as Ian Watt explains in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has experienced both contempt and admiration, facing accusations of superficiality while being celebrated for its evocation of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre and create a novel form of literary expression. Walpole combines \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' naturalistic approaches found in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws upon medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had already been applied to various peoples, styles, and historical periods. It was often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" social and literary \"progress.\" What has allowed Gothic literature to endure and remain simultaneously antiquated yet fresh to readers far removed from its origins is its unique combination of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's innovative format, which offers intimate insights into character psychology.\n\nOne of the most significant gothic elements present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry and knightly training is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, emphasized chivalry because it represented an ideal - the quintessential knight: brave, honorable, and capable - which they perceived as lacking in their contemporary society. Through the incorporation of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing Gothic literature's evolution into Romanticism) and serves as a tool for contemporary social critique. Walpole, writing during politically turbulent times and facing personal struggles, may have believed that the moral integrity and inherent \"goodness\" of the gothic era had somehow disappeared from his contemporary society. This theme is evident in several characters, notably Frederic, who embodies numerous chivalric traits and is portrayed through traditional knightly imagery, though with the characteristic Gothic tendency toward excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management represents the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution stages until they reach the customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently. A supply chain consists of six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these six key elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the foundation and initial step in the supply chain process. It defines the when, why, where, and how of all manufacturing activities. Managers must understand customer preferences, primarily by analyzing market trends - the most significant indicator of customer demand. Once managers have assessed the market and comprehended customer demands, they can determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities. They then select appropriate production facilities based on volume capabilities and quality standards, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The next phase involves scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production represents a crucial step in the supply chain process, where every detail matters. Improper planning could result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, from my experience at Walmart and Target, these retailers maintain detailed protocols for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, ensuring smooth operations through clear directives and expectations.\n\nThe second key element, supply, encompasses strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and expertise. Managers must determine which division best suits different production processes and may opt to outsource certain operations. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are distinguished by their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the period's aristocracy. Two novels that are considered Victorian but deviate from this tradition are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\". Both works employ elements of mystery and an inclination toward the bizarre, which is uncommon for novels of this period, serving to strengthen the characters in each work while providing insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n[...] \n\nThe day passed – day! There was no day; it had vanished as quickly as it had come – and night fell again; a night so long yet so brief; long in its terrible silence and brief in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years ago, I worked as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary school students. I did my best to help them in any subject they struggled with, though my strengths were in English and reading. One of the teachers recruited me to help a young boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was having significant difficulties with reading. I realized something wasn't quite right; he was experiencing the most unusual problems. He could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others were completely foreign to him - it was quite puzzling. While he was clearly of Latino heritage and spoke perfect English, we continued to struggle until I met his mother. One day, while supervising a few remaining students during a field trip day, his mother came in. She didn't speak any English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish knowledge (I was just learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me like lightning: Adrian could read perfectly well, he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier challenges in schools, particularly in California, and to demonstrate that these issues aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can present significant obstacles. While we all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? In Adrian's case, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. No single approach - whether dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes - can solve this alone. The key lies in combining all these methods.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is an excellent concept - not just for native Spanish speakers, but for all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. While some fear this approach wastes resources or won't benefit the majority of students, this is incorrect. If we implemented these programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would benefit. Does this mean requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual teaching assistants and tutors to support this approach.",
            "From childhood on, most of us are told that there is something greater than ourselves, greater than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school, others go to temple, or search for answers within themselves. Many of us readily accept the religions passed down to us by our parents. Some, however, reject them completely, denying that there could be anything beyond the knowable in our own egocentric universe. We might adopt one value system, only to later change our minds and replace it with another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives on spirituality. We search for a light in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof above while smoking our cigarettes together. The gutters channeled the rain down, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely from his frame. His hair had thinned too, sparser than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to tell my father how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the falling rain in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, but kept him alive a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't determine the value of this when it merely prolonged his suffering. What kind of God would do this, I wondered. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I thought, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI hadn't wanted to watch him pass from this life into another. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to witness the ending of the life that had created mine. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily a farmer, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man known for his commitment and candor in matters of personal liberty and governance. His devotion to an agricultural system formed the foundation for virtually all his views on government. His efforts to preserve and promote what he considered the most noble of all professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nHe believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, free from the constraints of established traditions, thus enabling true self-governance. Taylor held strong convictions about natural human rights, arguing that these rights were interconnected—if one was compromised, all would eventually fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. Therefore, these rights should remain beyond government reach. He argued against what some termed the \"state of nature,\" where physical strength and cunning intelligence prevailed, asserting that civilization must operate differently.\n\nTaylor maintained that an effective government must acknowledge both the virtuous and corrupt aspects of human nature. He held firm to his dualistic view of morality, asserting that \"Since government is administered by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified positive principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and limiting capitalism, believing that a government founded on such principles would function justly regardless of its leadership, which he saw as inevitably driven by self-interest and greed. While he viewed self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it harmful only when it led to the formation of privileged groups thriving at others' expense.\n\nAs a dedicated Republican of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored a highly limited federal government, restricted to powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical. However, he warned against overly literal interpretation, arguing that understanding the framers' intent was crucial to prevent corruption. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, as it more clearly depicted the United States as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "Downward I gazed, my mind barely processing the sight before me. With detached precision and practiced awareness, I analyzed the scene, refusing to connect it to any deeper meaning. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, appearing and vanishing almost instantaneously. My mind worked with such fluid efficiency that it seemed I wasn't truly thinking, just experiencing what lay before me.\n\nOnce, following an artist's recommendation, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since age six, I'd wanted to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to how the brain processes visual information. One key technique involved placing a frame around the subject, transforming complex scenes - like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room - into manageable, focused compositions.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't mentally impose such a frame. The sight before me was too overwhelming, too striking in its crude reality. While Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, here I stood, facing what could only be called my \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers gripped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved, transforming intention into action in what might have been my most memorable creative moment, though not for the reasons I'd ever imagined. Water swirled peacefully, crystal clear at first. Particles separated and drifted away. With increasing urgency, my hand pushed the handle again, but the stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the toilet's bottom, unmoved and defiant.\n\nStanding there in my work uniform, green tie uncomfortably tight, mop in hand, I contemplated this unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron of Rite Aid's restroom.

Then, like a cook retrieving a roast from the oven, I steeled myself for the unpleasant task ahead...",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives behind the wheel. Multiple factors combine to create this deadly statistical pattern for America's youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem lies in the fact that the adolescent brain is literally not prepared for the dangers of driving. Lack of experience is also at the core of the problem. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also results in higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and running off the road.\n\nTeenagers face significantly greater risks when traveling with their peers—something anyone with common sense knows happens regularly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study demonstrating a clear correlation between passenger age and traffic accident frequency.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to enhance teen driver safety by implementing provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minor passengers. However, in my view, provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical measures, simply unable to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common tendency among those under 19-20 to seek risks purely for the thrill.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to postpone driving until this thrill-seeking tendency begins to diminish. If we continue issuing licenses to young teens, we'll not only continue to witness deadly accidents but likely see the death toll rise to alarming levels in coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby-Boomers will be eligible to drive, putting millions of new teen drivers on the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue could be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit system could remain in place before granting full licenses, along with required practical training hours. These requirements could be based on existing state standards (California, for instance, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Since teen driving statistics show similar patterns across all states, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and potentially effective approach to protecting teens nationwide.\n\nThis legislative proposal is not a new concept.",
            "This paper addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a brief definition of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is explained, including common characteristics and warning signs. Finally, the paper discusses ways in which teachers can support students with CAPD in an integrated classroom setting.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes how effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In specific terms, it refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that generates electrophysiological auditory potentials. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities but are not considered hearing impaired; rather, the brain regions responsible for processing auditory input, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, do not function typically.\n\nThe condition was first documented in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961, which established a model explaining the physiology of auditory perception. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: affected individuals may struggle with sound localization, difficulty distinguishing between multiple sound events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking, difficulty synthesizing sound information meaningfully, and problems processing the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis requires systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. The assessment may involve questionnaires, behavioral observation, and various auditory skill evaluations. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool with consistent success rates, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many diagnostic procedures involve testing the patient's ability to differentiate between simultaneous auditory stimuli, while advanced methods include measuring acoustic responses within the ear.",
            "In pursuing my studies in social work, I aim to build a career with the Department of Family and Children Services to assist abused or neglected children and support troubled families. The values I can bring to social work include: service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving relationships between others, and commitment to my own professional development to maintain competence in my field. These core values aren't just important for social workers; they're personally important to me.\n\nI've always wanted to help others, though I was uncertain about my career path. During my high school and college years, I witnessed many people running from their problems, with some using less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. These experiences led me to pursue a psychology degree. Still uncertain about my career direction, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy sitting on her couch. She explained he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents' house. Wanting to help, I drove to his parents' home. There, I privately shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was nothing legally they could do for the teenager. The parents appeared nervous and made excuses to explain their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality and mourn those we've lost, yet our concept of \"individuality\" often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing true uniqueness. I am an individual who refuses to limit myself to conform to others' expectations. Throughout my academic years, I protested against social injustice in various ways: dying my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that expressed my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, openly participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models as they relate to the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects, while the sociocultural models examine environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and elaborates on selected research findings to better explain the models. The research explanations and their findings are then analyzed critically to identify their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as either a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder connected to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other conditions. Primary sleep disorders are classified as either Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional categories of sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance use. The Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both lasting for at least one month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are sleep disorders characterized by behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for about two and a half years now, equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls - practically the easternmost point of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The journey from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in State College's frequently adverse weather conditions.\n\nSpeaking with a recent alumnus, I discovered that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast stretches of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with athletic fields, major new buildings including the new Creamery and health services facility, and is surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What's the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, the bicycle alone isn't the solution - students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure needs to accommodate cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after several years. He wondered why he'd ever stopped, saying, \"Bicycles are fantastic - there was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A simple breakfast and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. Purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas building, normally a twenty-five-minute walk from my residence. By bicycle, I can reduce this to just 5 minutes with sufficient effort. The only challenge is that Pollock Road, while the most direct route to Thomas building from my home, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on foot or by bicycle. While walking has its merits, my schedule is too demanding for it to be practical. Without my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable option for reaching classes. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes of my time - over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all the other walking time for various classes, appointments, and other commitments, and it amounts to more time than I can afford to spend.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of both technology and capitalistic structures through the creation of a dystopia in \"Brave New World.\" In this world, community value supersedes individualism, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. The population serves as mere pawns in a greater scheme, confined within an ideology dictated by the World Controller. When analyzing the work through Marxist theory, one can observe the author's underlying skepticism regarding the development of these systems. Common Marxist concepts such as homogeneity and reification reinforce the notion that Huxley's novel serves as commentary on the flaws in his era's emerging economy.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The general populace remains ignorant of their true economic relationship with other classes, focused solely on personal gain. This results from ideological control of the proletariat and workers, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning in Brave New World. The lower classes - Delta, Gamma, and others - lack genuine free will; through hypnopaedia, their drive to consume, spend, and indulge is artificially enhanced. This manipulation stems from the World Controller's authority. Hegemony - the complete domination of social classes by a select group - is evidently at play. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the system. The upper classes possess awareness of this reality but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard take meaningful action. Indeed, the class interactions serve as powerful indicators of capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nGenuine interpersonal relationships are nonexistent in Brave New World. Characters lack depth, even among protagonists, perhaps suggesting Huxley's view that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of free will and expression. Love is absent, as are extreme emotions; instead, interactions remain superficial, illustrated by men's focus on women's physical attributes and women's casual discussion of their encounters. Moreover, each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to communal roles mirrors Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islamic studies course at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more pertinent today than ever before. Looking back at events since 9/11, I have personally witnessed mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I doubt that in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has clear Muslim connections in his family background.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, the biography contradicts Muhammad's personality. From my previous knowledge and studies, I had understood that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the Islamic faith. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as something of a martyr, misunderstood by others and displaying humility, after which people gradually recognized the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nMoreover, there are remarkable parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' The most striking example is when he supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This writing style suggests to me that the authors wanted to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived in truth and miracles. This kind of narrative particularly troubles me as it seems to diminish Jesus Christ's miracles and life. It appears as though they're appropriating Jesus' life and character through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts that seem intended to provide 'witness testimony' or examples of people who 'independently' converted to Islam. However, these stories often come from third-hand sources - tales passed down through multiple people. I found this problematic because while it was meant to validate the stories' authenticity, it actually made them less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle man. Historical accounts contradict this portrayal of Muhammad as gentle and humble, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his convictions during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the development of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history in broad strokes, we see Christianity trending increasingly away from its origins. Today's world shows an ever-increasing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditional people remain and will resist thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow tremendously in the coming years. A desire will emerge to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of the religion's founder. Though it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: There will be a great reversal in Christian history's trajectory. There will be a return to its original form. A movement will grow that strips away layers of doctrine, one after another, as if time were moving backward, until only Jesus's original divine message to humanity remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as in Jesus's time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong as a guide. However, as the theological clock turns backward, Christianity's extreme diversity will consolidate into greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities rather than differences. Human history is full of such great reversals. Consider how Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our nation has progressed from enslaving African-Americans to having African-American leadership. The coming great reversion will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. Crucially, this process will be enabled by reading Jesus's words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has transpired since Jesus's lifetime? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. Monotheism, the concept of divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Jewish population was not unified, being divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe \"The Jungle\" demonstrates how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered at their core. They are solely focused on looking after themselves and optimizing their own lives, while showing no concern for those beneath them. \"The Jungle\" illustrates this in numerous ways, most notably through the behavior of factory owners and managers. Their singular focus is on expanding their companies and factories to their maximum potential, showing complete disregard for anyone or anything that stands in their way or suffers due to their progress. According to Upton Sinclair's depiction, the industrial landscape dominated the sky with its stark buildings and towering chimneys, spewing endless streams of smoke into the distance - a powerful image of environmental devastation and corporate indifference.\n\nThe owners and managers showed equal disregard for the workers who generated their wealth. They would take any measure to increase profits or reduce costs, creating an environment that was \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where human value was consistently subordinate to financial gain. Workers faced arbitrary layoffs without notice or compensation, endured grueling hours, and worked in dangerous conditions without any legal protections or safety regulations. Though never explicitly stated, the residents of Packingtown were expected to silently endure both the horrific working conditions in the factories and the squalid living conditions surrounding them. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than helped the workers they claimed to represent. The working population, largely comprised of poor immigrants, existed in a state comparable to slavery, perpetually teetering on the edge of starvation and subject to the whims of employers who proved as ruthless as slave drivers of the past. Under such a system, moral degradation became not just likely but inevitable.",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain that the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil's use of the term is certain, there is a more contemporary source that deserves recognition. Poe had a strong interest in German authors.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. In his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt notes the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he drinks heavily and weeps remembering his dead queen. Deciding his time has come, he bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The King of Thule's disposition and the king's portrayal in Dream-Land bear striking similarities, perhaps representing a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and reliance on alcohol.\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works: once as \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker depicts Thule's landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by deceased friends, viewing a colorless, shadowed world. These scenes parallel \"The King of Thule,\" where the protagonist has lost his wife, experiences isolation, and loses his will to rule or live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was an influential author whom Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his respect for Tennyson. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions that followed the original publication.",
            "Under California law, the question arises whether a customer who was injured after slipping on spilled applesauce in a grocery store could be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted maliciously, given that he was notified twice about the spill but failed to have it cleaned for thirty minutes while he was having his dinner.\n\nThe judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damages claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the likely harm of leaving a spill uncleaned, especially given that multiple D&D customers had suffered slip-and-fall injuries in previous months. While her argument about the despicable nature of Martin's actions may be less compelling, it remains reasonable considering that six similar incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still failed to implement proper safety measures.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager Paul Martin about an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin, who was on his dinner break, dismissed the matter, stating he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. It's worth noting that five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D during 2009. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nUnder California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded for non-contractual obligations if the defendant's actions demonstrated \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful or, lacking direct intent, \"despicable\" and executed with \"willful and conscious disregard for others' rights or safety.\" California courts have interpreted malicious conduct as actions taken with conscious disregard when the defendant \"was aware of the likely dangerous consequences of their behavior and willfully failed to avoid those consequences.\"",
            "She had always sensed something was missing in her life. It was an unfulfillable longing that persisted. It began when she was around 14, just entering her teenage years, and remained with her three years later at 17. By then, she had realized she was searching for someone rather than something. Yet no boys caught her interest. Several had been drawn to her, making awkward attempts to court the un-courtable, but none appealed to her. She often questioned this peculiar situation, trying to understand what could cause such an unusual circumstance in a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced theories, but none satisfactory enough to seriously consider. So she continued living, constantly examining her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed people who never quarreled with each other and, surprisingly, rarely argued with their daughter. Their only conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Though born to serene parents, she balanced their calm nature with her vibrant and engaging personality, making her well-liked, especially combined with her inherent kindness.\n\nThis day, however, was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking fresh inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice cry out from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic-stricken, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, taking short, pained breaths. \"Honey,\" her mother managed between gasps, \"I need... hospital.\" The words came out strained, and her daughter could see she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just show me where I can lift you.\" Her mother guided her hands, and at that moment, the household's hero was thankful for her strength training classes. She carried her mother to the car, carefully laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital visit brought familiar scents of antiseptic and illness, tinged with anxiety. But she noticed none of this, focused entirely on helping her mother. She rushed in carrying the injured woman, calling urgently for medical help. Concerned staff quickly gathered, bringing a gurney where they placed her mother. They whisked her away for immediate examination, leaving her daughter to wait in worried solitude.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepstool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with lower risks of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet represents a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but encompassing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats) and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention trial demonstrated the Mediterranean diet's superiority over low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese subjects. However, earlier studies had not specifically examined stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, comprising approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study accounted for potential confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe findings revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by higher aMed scores, was associated with reduced risk of both CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares that Hitler lives in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by an oppressive military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, several street demonstrations erupted, marking the first public protests in ten years. These protests, led by numerous Burmese monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began taking interest, and while the Burmese government initially reluctantly permitted the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, the situation soon escalated into what some viewed as outright warfare between the monks and the military regime, with forces actively raiding and pillaging monasteries throughout the country. Foreign journalists were immediately arrested, with Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for witnessing a street protest. While official figures cite 13 deaths, Colonel Hla Win, who deserted the army days before the official report, stated, \"The death toll in recent days far exceeds what's been reported. The number of bodies runs into thousands.\"\n\nThis pattern is nothing unprecedented. While these represent some of the most recent examples of worldwide atrocities, governments' desires to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their populations have existed throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection for complete authority over their society. Japanese emperors were considered divine beings, supposedly sent to guide their people toward prosperity through developments like Motorola phones and ritual suicide, while our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly discussions with Ted Haggard, who leads Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nAmong the most notorious examples are the June 4th, 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where scholars, workers' rights activists, and students gathered to oppose authoritarian rule. Casualty figures vary dramatically, with official Chinese government reports claiming 200-300 deaths, while Chinese Red Cross reports indicate 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s represents another instance, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically eliminated Tutsis and political moderates regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's Third Reich, spanning multiple years and countries, during which Jewish people were systematically rounded up and killed, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his longevity and, consequently, his creative ability to shape his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his brilliance as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated passages that leveraged band members' unique styles to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he enhanced the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinctive and cohesive sounds tailored to each piece. His masterful understanding of individual musicians' sounds and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz history's most groundbreaking works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's sonic innovation, particularly referencing Creole Love Call as an example of his pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work demonstrates his skill in using vocals to add depth and color without relying on lyrics, while showcasing his ability to complement his soloists' styles - a trait evident throughout his musical journey. This measured twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\n[Chorus descriptions remain essentially the same, with minor stylistic variations]\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice as a tonal element in this piece exemplifies a stylistic signature that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with his keen sense for tonal color. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending Miley's vocal-like playing with Cox's instrumental-style vocals. This approach evolves further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a cornerstone of his orchestra, introducing the melody with his distinctive muted trombone style.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson declared in 1917 that \"even now zoologists have barely begun to dream of defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" the same holds true today. In recent times, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk shell formation through both individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help illuminate the mechanisms involved in the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes.\n\nA shell can be understood as a tube-like structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral revolutions of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line known as the suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The apex marks the spire's tip, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"standard\" orientation shows the shell in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls begins by viewing the shell from above and identifying where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and are measured to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It's possible to track the aperture's path using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically, allowing for parameter variation and modification of mollusk shell development once mathematically formulated.",
            "The infant and child mortality rate in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is progressing toward achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the improvement rates for child and maternal health fall far short of the progress needed to meet their 2015 targets. The various reasons for these deficiencies will be discussed below, suggesting a need to strengthen the healthcare system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has shown progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this category still includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in cases of complicated pregnancies (explaining the high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). In essence, the improvements in this particular indicator are somewhat deceptive, and considerable work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by healthcare professionals. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area is also problematic, with low rates throughout the country.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%. These rates also highlight another concerning disparity: while urban areas show a 7% c-section rate, rural areas only show 2%. This underscores the issue of inequitable healthcare coverage across the country. Healthcare services are clearly concentrated in urban areas. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. The poor evidently face greater difficulties accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to most effectively address the service gap. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing exclusively on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches to address the above issues are appealing, as they offer more targeted, manageable objectives and typically yield faster results, there are important drawbacks to consider. A major concern is that heavy investment in one particular health sector often depletes funding for other areas and attracts human resources away from other essential services (as seen in the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs leads to service duplication and lack of coordination, resulting in increased bureaucracy and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded so dramatically over the last century that it now encompasses such a vast array of genres that creating a definitive list has become nearly impossible. Adding to this complexity, virtually all genres—including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, to name just a few—have generated multiple sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres within their respective domains.\n\nHeavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably evolved into one of popular music's most diverse and expressive genres over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though it tends to gravitate toward darker themes. Its diversity emerged shortly after the genre's inception, when artists began to recognize and exploit its inherent flexibility, creating distinct sub-genres that continued to branch into further subdivisions—a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has become so nuanced and fragmented that defining its exact nature has become challenging. While it has absorbed influences from numerous other genres, it maintains its own distinct origins. To truly comprehend today's omnipresent metal music, one must understand both the metal movement itself and why it constitutes a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be viewed as a \"music of excess\"—greater bass, increased volume, enhanced violence, and heightened theatricality. It eschews primitivism in favor of technical proficiency; metal musicians are notably skilled instrumentalists, a quality that clearly manifests in their music. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, which led to the creation of increasingly experimental, otherworldly recordings. Metal embraces dark, visceral qualities that were relatively uncommon in popular music of the time, and later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era.\n\nThe example of Helter Skelter demonstrates the Beatles' darker side, portraying an up-and-down journey often associated with drug use. Some consider this song one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, created as a response to a similarly heavy Rolling Stones song. The Beatles, seeking to prove they could match the Stones' intensity, included it on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dream-like works, the artist Henri Rousseau was already carefully shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman overwhelmed by the wonders of the land she visits in her dream but also represents Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. From the beginning of his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, finding himself confronted with a difficult internal dilemma in pursuing this goal. \"The Dream\" is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his lifelong inner struggle: whether to conform to or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to allow himself to develop creatively independent and unique, forging his own path as he went.\n\nBefore analyzing The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Rousseau came from a middle-class background, his father being a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed modest prosperity. Having received no formal artistic training, he worked until the age of forty as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) for France, though he was mistakenly nicknamed douanier (customs inspector). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one surviving child, a daughter named Julia, and profound grief. He sought refuge in a new life through painting, which offered him solace and fresh beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasant life in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk painter who embodied the hopes and dreams of his social class.",
            "Many great thinkers have proposed an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" Much of our life's knowledge comes through education or experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics without these conventional teaching methods.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore importantly, critiques of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. While we might discuss the Mona Lisa in terms of foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, these elements alone don't explain what makes it great art. People often preface their analysis of favorite artworks or literature with \"There's just something about it\" before delving into more detailed explanations. I believe both art and morality resist complete reduction to their component qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Something transcendent always remains beyond our descriptions of literature, and I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is perhaps the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, creating a bridge between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely intertwined because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use Kant's terminology. They affect us in ways we can experience but cannot fully explain. This connection is particularly strong in literature. As McKean observes, literature's distinctive feature is its moral quality. While moral standards might not apply to other arts like music, they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living inherently involves values, and literature's significance lies precisely in the values we discover within it.",
            "Today's Germany is regarded as a powerful force, a unified nation with its own cultural blend stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This same culture can be experienced from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's heartland to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given such a distinctive culture, it's not surprising that the Germany we know today emerged from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the German people. The origin of its name remains highly contested among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed the name came from a Germanic tribe then known as the Tungrians, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battle with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought against Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine with hostile intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin remains uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gallic language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continuously at war... They engage with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can serve as a useful tool for sustaining extended deceptions, one must ultimately shed this newly adopted facade or risk losing their true self in the process. A significant challenge in ending such deception lies in the potential alienation that follows. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their authentic self or maintaining their relationships with others.\n\nThe issue of deception through gender role reversal proves particularly complex, raising numerous questions - chief among them being the motivation behind such transformations. In Viola's case, her disguise clearly serves as a means of self-preservation, as evidenced when she states: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in foreign territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection, though this choice isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. Her convincing performance as a man leads to complicated romantic entanglements, particularly with Olivia's mistaken affections and her own suppressed feelings for Orsino.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can catalyze the emergence of hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. While some might question whether Olivia's attraction to Cesario suggests deeper implications about her sexuality, it seems more likely that Shakespeare used this situation to satirize the superficiality of attraction based purely on appearances. This interpretation is supported by how readily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest.",
            "German colonial rule has been criticized by various observers for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Herero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Naturally, such a vast colonial empire cannot be characterized by such a simple description. The German colonial empire exhibited as much diversity in its policies and governing style as it did in its geography. Educational opportunities across the colonies were equally varied. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Cameroon and other colonies also received praise from contemporary authors.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (today's Namibia) stood in sharp contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and took a leading role in native education, in South West Africa the education of indigenous peoples was left almost entirely to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did, however, invest considerable resources in educating European settlers, establishing state schools and providing stronger support and regulation for missionary schools serving the white population. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies could boast significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the vast majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's divergent experience. This study aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors, with particular emphasis on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German and date from the early twentieth century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in colonial educational systems. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa most directly addresses this paper's topic. Cohen compares the educational systems of both colonies and examines factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, South West Africa's large settler population explains many distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of the region consists of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico exemplify two nations that were once caught in a lasting rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The pinnacle of this conflict was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other confrontations occurred between the two nations, finally subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes over religion, culture, traditions, and significant material interests.\n\nThis pattern mirrors many other nations experiencing enduring rivalries with their neighbors. Countries sharing borders often face conflicting interests that lead to rivalries. The U.S.-Mexico case reflects a common pattern among neighboring nations with sustained conflicts. As David M. Pletcher (1977) noted, \"Only Mexico and Cuba presented persistent, overarching diplomatic challenges for America\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations' proximity to the United States contributed to their rival status, while other Latin American countries maintained generally positive relations.\n\nReligious differences created a divide between the nations, a common historical phenomenon. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, this rivalry centered on religious rather than political differences. The mutual distrust inherited from their former colonial powers - England and Spain - significantly hindered the development of friendly relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry. Most conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier challenges. Bandit attacks on American border towns remained problematic until both nations established stronger military presence along their borders.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States, and finally concluded when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness whose existence I had never known about.\n\nI was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply rooted need for security and safety that I lacked as a child. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So - even though my dream was to be a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old and single, with barely any savings and unable to work. To this day I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left to call my own. I get by, but each day is a battle that challenges my security, safety, and self-worth. While nothing in my life is certain anymore, one truth remains clear: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, regardless of how strong I was. And trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy message is that life will always bring emergencies - both major and minor. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are simply too great to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that we in the U.S. need to stop relying solely on big government - heaven knows that basket is moldy and falling apart anyway. But I'd much rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help one another and to ask for help - rather than each of us retreating to our backyards to build individual fallout shelters.\n\nAmerican Conservatives speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built this nation, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors through hard times wasn't individualism - it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of biological attack. I have multiple flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods too. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food - do it. It's an excellent idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're doing all that, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism—with its most orthodox branch known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion, now approximately twenty-five centuries old, appears quite different today than it did during Buddha's lifetime. This transformation is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which holds religious significance, despite Buddha never having taught about such festivities. These variations extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological essence of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has needed to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by forces both external and internal, hostile and benign.\n\nVarious qualifying terms are essential to this discussion. The concept of internal versus external forces is key: internal forces emerge from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—arising from negative perceptions of Buddhism. A benign force neither intends to help nor harm the Buddhist community, though it may inadvertently do either. These distinctions will be referenced throughout this discussion.\n\nTo understand these changes, one must first grasp the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily contained within the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka encompasses Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these concepts is crucial for ending Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara comes the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) through enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes life's rules: five precepts for laypeople (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks follow numerous additional disciplinary rules. At Buddhism's doctrinal core lie the four noble truths, beginning with Dukkha—the truth that life contains suffering, followed by the understanding that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a vital role in every negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually is and represents. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a specific thing. It is also not uniform or standardized. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently too general and overly simplified. While understanding cultural generalizations has its place, it is more productive for a negotiator to understand the relevance of a culture to the current situation and how that culture's attitudes can and will influence the discussions. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in relation to one's own culture, and comparisons inevitably arise.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve everything from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must accept it for what it is and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations, and particularly when coming to the table from a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when a negotiator finds themselves in foreign territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can only help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Most companies within a nation develop their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize extended working hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture manifests in dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, task delegation), and recruitment practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to company-approved charities or fundraisers. The variations in American corporate culture from company to company (including regional differences and urban-suburban distinctions) demonstrate the diversity of thought possible within a particular societal culture. Some cultures may appear more uniform than American culture to outsiders, but similar appearances often indicate a need to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly crucial to understand as they reveal the underlying motivations of a culture. In cultures that prioritize saving face or community harmony, a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed at negotiations. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't necessarily rush to reach an agreement. While considering these general principles is important before negotiations begin, a negotiator benefits from understanding their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiation.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart: 'There is no God.'\" This quotation first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and stands at the beginning of St. Anselm's argumentation regarding God's existence. This conviction appears to be shared by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Since their arguments both address the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, proceed from their shared correct belief in God's existence, specifically the God of the Bible. To consider a god-like figure that might not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not allow us to properly compare their arguments, as they are essentially defending one specific conception of God. With this in mind, I would propose that while both present valid points, neither provides a truly comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, let us first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a journey of gaining understanding through faith, looking inward to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, expressed in his terminology, is somewhat cumbersome and occasionally unclear, the essential message is that proof of God resides within one's own mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own soul to find truth about God; rather, His existence is proven simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. External evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is no irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to in Christian texts as faith.\n\nThis approach differs markedly from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead proposes that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. Such an approach would be advantageous in evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without depending on their willingness to accept unprovable assertions. They could instead be convinced through pure logic. St. Thomas develops five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially demonstrates that proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God's existence. It's like being told you're missing one puzzle piece and assembling the rest - logic allows you to know the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers regarding important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs many of these different techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" At times, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject for his readers. In other instances, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald applies this latter technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald constructs meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later employs these meanings to evoke specific emotional associations with important objects in readers' minds.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald establishes and uses for white/gray represents uniformity, with white suggesting a more refined and upper-class quality, while gray indicates something more aged and faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the novel's beginning through consistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" - indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick in his \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom in his \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine \"powdered milky white.\" The only exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to common, unremarkable elements: Nick travels through \"white chasms of lower New York,\" the names at Gatsby's parties become \"gray names,\" and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - all suggesting uniformity.",
            "San Diego County demonstrates remarkable agricultural productivity, owing to its mild, sun-rich climate. The region produces a diverse array of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, fruit trees such as peach and lemon, berries, honey, and peppers. The San Diego area features a robust market for organic community-supported agriculture, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and dairy products enjoy significant popularity. Many organic farms extend their offerings beyond agriculture, providing guided tours of their operations and allowing access for hiking, bird watching, and various recreational pursuits. This operational model enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat quality, facilitating recreational use, and creating revenue opportunities through farm tours and educational programs.\n\nBeyond serving a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming typically promotes greater biodiversity in both flora and fauna due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, organic farming does present certain increased costs compared to conventional methods. It demands more intensive labor and management for pest control, weed removal, and natural soil fertilization, often experiencing higher crop losses than conventional farming, while small organic operations lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, though not strictly tied to organic farming, may incur extra labor costs, including cover crop cultivation, planned grazing rotation, invasive species management, and deliberate vegetation management to create specific habitat features like edge environments or open ground areas. These factors explain why landowners might seek financial assistance or expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario comprises 160 acres adjacent to Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, featuring chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, currently under review, encompasses over a hundred plant and animal species, including endangered species like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as potentially soon-to-be-listed species such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis land carries a rich history, having been home to Native American peoples for centuries before transitioning to cattle ranching and firewood production in the late 1800s. Originally established through a homestead patent, the property likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. The property was identified through real estate listings, with subsequent research into available government programs to explore realistic options for small farmers interested in cost mitigation and wildlife conservation. A local organic farm serves as a model for potential agricultural approaches on this land.",
            "There exists a connection between brothers - an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within this connection lie numerous emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name but a few. Brothers understand each other on a level that surpasses any other relationship of this kind, and they can truly see themselves only when looking at their brother. It is during the most desperate situations that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether for good or ill. When these emotions surface, they bring with them a hefty price. Understanding the emotions that stem from this fraternal connection means confronting their consequences. When one looks into a brother's eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their genuine character manifests in their actions and the consequences thereof.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme and all the turbulent emotions that accompany it. Against a richly detailed, vibrant backdrop, these two boys embark on what proves to be a futile journey. In the story's climactic moment, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, their interactions, and through the narrator's perspective, which conveys both the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his worldview - both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be traced back to a single driving emotion: pride. From his first outings with his younger brother Doodle until their final, fatal encounter, the protagonist harbors resentment toward Doodle. He had yearned for a brother he could teach his worldly skills to, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted someone to \"race to Horsehead Landing\" and \"perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn.\" Given Doodle's condition, these activities were clearly impossible. Doodle was born with a severely weak heart, making his survival doubtful, let alone participation in strenuous physical activities. What a crushing disappointment for the young protagonist, whose head was filled with wild dreams, to have them shattered in an instant. His anger toward the small child even manifested in thoughts of suffocation with a pillow - a disturbing consideration for a child. Yet, when the small child smiled at him, his heart softened. Such a simple gesture gave the protagonist such hope, suggesting his darker impulses weren't deeply rooted. Deep down, he possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate, creative information processing system. As technology progressed from primitive to modern forms, the metaphors used to describe the brain evolved accordingly. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a papyrus scroll, then to a book, and most recently to a computer. When studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limited utility and can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries - where colors change significantly across short distances - to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions made during bottom-up processing to accelerate your recognition of the box, helping you identify it as a solid black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. While your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your feet, a properly functioning attention filter prevents you from consciously noting each one. Conversely, you might detect your name being called even in a crowded, noisy environment. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nInformation storage precedes processing in the brain. Several memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is first encoded, with different encoding methods for various sensory inputs. Verbal information, for example, can be encoded structurally (appearance of written words), phonemically (sound of words), or semantically (meaning of words). Stored information must then be maintained. Research with animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, operates through electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits. Long-term memory storage is believed to involve structural changes in certain proteins.\n\nMultiple models exist to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval studies, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which in turn links to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most significant corporations were left in ruins. This recession's effects continue to be felt today, prompting us to examine how this crisis occurred and how we can prevent similar situations in the future. In essence, the financial crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed banks and firms to issue subprime loans within an already inadequate financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves, spreading this turmoil throughout the repackaged mortgages they had sold and into the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis had its origins in 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought re-election by boosting his popularity. The Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, Fannie Mae, the nation's leading mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage accessibility to low and moderate-income borrowers while simultaneously satisfying shareholders' demands for continued profit growth. Holmes presciently warned that this government-subsidized corporation might face difficulties during an economic downturn, potentially requiring government intervention similar to the savings and loan industry rescue in the 1980s.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of complex mortgage structures. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years deeply entangled various economic sectors with the housing market. This led American households and financial markets to become overly invested in housing, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing approximately 30% of U.S. GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's forced conversion to commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That moment in your story where you spread your little writer's wings and take off, aiming to impress everyone with your captivating, indeed magical prose. Or it's the part where your readers fall asleep and/or click the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known for yelling at her screen when she finds herself drowning in too much information, and not even in the entertaining way.\n\nExposition isn't your ally.\n\nWhile our dear readers are familiar with the fundamental writing principle \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still catches herself writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or worse, too much happens. Exposition is like that little devil perched on your shoulder, suggesting you get all the background information out of the way to reach the good parts (not to be confused with that other devil on your opposite shoulder, urging you to share every minute detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially telling your audience what occurred, typically through straightforward prose. In films, exposition happens when one character downloads a heap of information onto another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. When reading a story, you might be told about how the heroine met her beloved, their grand wedding, and his subsequent murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only two lines of dialogue each. Instead, you'd expect the author to develop the husband's character, revealing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife, while showing through various means how his presence transformed and enriched her life. A proper character introduction would allow readers to form an emotional connection to his fate while gaining insight into the heroine's character: what attracted her to him, the depth of their bond, and glimpses of her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his perspective. You would share in her grief at his loss, thereby forming a stronger connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance beyond the basic plot points of \"They met, they married, he died.\"",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story concerned a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. While her name wasn't disclosed, he was identified as Shad Hostettler. They showed his police photograph, and he had an absolutely sinister appearance. They dedicated only about two minutes to this developing story. The only details provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I believe they allocated an appropriate amount of time to this story.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, age 18. He was critically wounded in the Sharon Woods area, with no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was conducting the investigation. The coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might have been related to the victim being African-American or the incident occurring in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed over the years that minority victims often receive minimal coverage. When a white person, whether child or adult, becomes a victim of crime or goes missing, the media provides extensive coverage; minority victims, however, often barely receive mention.\n\nThe subsequent story detailed a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided information about the suspected location of the incident. Investigators determined it was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nFollowing this was a weather report predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures expected to remain in the low to mid-eighties. Though brief, this appeared to be used as a teaser to maintain viewership.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall and weighing around one hundred fifty pounds. The coverage seemed to place unusual emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone.\n\nThe final story concerned Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than twenty-five years, perhaps to make it sound more severe. They also mentioned his Hispanic ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. While these advantages are highly attractive, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as having to pay trading commissions on ETF transactions, just as with stocks. Another advantage is the wide range of available ETF options. Although these benefits are clearly outlined, prudent financial investors should always evaluate whether claimed benefits, such as diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the single ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten individual stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nTo make the evaluation manageable, we've chosen to focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The top 10 holdings and their respective asset percentages are listed below.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we can normalize their asset percentages to 100% and calculate each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the complete ETF. These initial findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower risk. However, we must consider whether these differences in means are statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance between these portfolios, we calculated the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalized to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. The onset of winter at a New England campus naturally leads to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which might explain part of this decline. December coincides with the fall semester's conclusion, when everyone is overwhelmed with completing coursework, processing grades, and other end-of-term responsibilities. Many people may have simply forgotten about submitting their commuter logs during this busy time. Moreover, December brings the holiday season and its accompanying month-long break for students and faculty, during which many have no reason to visit campus at all. When classes resume in late January, this might also explain the low submission numbers for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for February's low submission rate. One could theorize that such projects typically experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a focused campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. Thus, we faced the dual challenge of maintaining project momentum against both natural engagement decline and the specific interruptions caused by academic breaks and holidays.\n\nA fundamental challenge for this project (and any alternative transportation initiative) lies in people's deep-seated attachment to the freedom, independence, and flexibility that personal vehicles provide. This is fundamentally woven into our cultural fabric. Consequently, providing compelling incentives for alternative commuting becomes crucial. While we distributed numerous prizes including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage services, independent bookstores, and national retailers, it would have been interesting to explore the impact of more substantial rewards – such as a premium bicycle, hybrid vehicle, or electric car. Such prizes might have helped prevent the participation decline we experienced. Since our prize structure remained constant throughout the project, implementing escalating prize values might have proved beneficial. While the initial gift cards seemed sufficient at the project's start, announcing more substantial prizes like bicycles in December and perhaps a hybrid or electric car in January might have sustained or even increased participation rather than seeing it decline.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I reviewed all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employ creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the common artistic elements found in most trick films while also exploring the unique evolutionary characteristics that emerged in some later works. Generally speaking, trick films at the turn of the century were characterized by set-based filming, frontal proscenium composition, stationary camera work, long and medium shots, and adherence to the principle of one shot equaling one complete film. However, some productions from the early twentieth century began challenging these conventions by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films is their interior set filming within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera maintains a fixed position rather than following the movement of people or objects. This compositional approach, deeply rooted in theatrical traditions and particularly influenced by vaudeville and magic performances, was widespread in early cinema. The stage-based format resulted in characters typically moving only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally across the frame, with the camera remaining stationary even when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. None of the Edison catalog's trick films employed close-up shots, reflecting the theatrical viewing experience where audiences observed the entire stage performance within the confines of the proscenium arch. As was typical in early cinema, performers stayed in the middle ground, never approaching the camera for close-up effects.\n\nMost early trick films followed the convention of one conceptual shot comprising the entire film. This approach limited most productions to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frame rate, and restricted their narrative scope. The majority featured brief vaudeville-style illusions, such as magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that what appears as one continuous shot to viewers often consisted of multiple physical shots cleverly joined to create illusions. This is evident in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the splice point where the shot of Mary's \"decapitation\" was inserted, though the film appears as one continuous take to the casual viewer.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" represents, both in substance and name, an \"oxymoron of 'Old-New'\" as Ian Watt explains in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has experienced both contempt and admiration, facing accusations of superficiality while being celebrated for its evocation of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre and create a novel form of literary expression. Walpole combines \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' naturalistic approaches found in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws upon medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had already been applied to various peoples, styles, and historical periods. It was often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" social and literary \"progress.\" What has allowed Gothic literature to endure and remain simultaneously antiquated yet fresh to readers far removed from its origins is its unique combination of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's innovative format, which offers intimate insights into character psychology.\n\nOne of the most significant gothic elements present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry and knightly training is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, emphasized chivalry because it represented an ideal - the quintessential knight: brave, honorable, and capable - which they perceived as lacking in their contemporary society. Through the incorporation of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing Gothic literature's evolution into Romanticism) and serves as a tool for contemporary social critique. Walpole, writing during politically turbulent times and facing personal struggles, may have believed that the moral integrity and inherent \"goodness\" of the gothic era had somehow disappeared from his contemporary society. This theme is evident in several characters, notably Frederic, who embodies numerous chivalric traits and is portrayed through traditional knightly imagery, though with the characteristic Gothic tendency toward excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management represents the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution stages until they reach the customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently. A supply chain consists of six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these six key elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the foundation and initial step in the supply chain process. It defines the when, why, where, and how of all manufacturing activities. Managers must understand customer preferences, primarily by analyzing market trends - the most significant indicator of customer demand. Once managers have assessed the market and comprehended customer demands, they can determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities. They then select appropriate production facilities based on volume capabilities and quality standards, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The next phase involves scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production represents a crucial step in the supply chain process, where every detail matters. Improper planning could result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, from my experience at Walmart and Target, these retailers maintain detailed protocols for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, ensuring smooth operations through clear directives and expectations.\n\nThe second key element, supply, encompasses strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and expertise. Managers must determine which division best suits different production processes and may opt to outsource certain operations. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are distinguished by their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the period's aristocracy. Two novels that are considered Victorian but deviate from this tradition are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\". Both works employ elements of mystery and an inclination toward the bizarre, which is uncommon for novels of this period, serving to strengthen the characters in each work while providing insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n[...] \n\nThe day passed – day! There was no day; it had vanished as quickly as it had come – and night fell again; a night so long yet so brief; long in its terrible silence and brief in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years ago, I worked as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary school students. I did my best to help them in any subject they struggled with, though my strengths were in English and reading. One of the teachers recruited me to help a young boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was having significant difficulties with reading. I realized something wasn't quite right; he was experiencing the most unusual problems. He could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others were completely foreign to him - it was quite puzzling. While he was clearly of Latino heritage and spoke perfect English, we continued to struggle until I met his mother. One day, while supervising a few remaining students during a field trip day, his mother came in. She didn't speak any English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish knowledge (I was just learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me like lightning: Adrian could read perfectly well, he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier challenges in schools, particularly in California, and to demonstrate that these issues aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can present significant obstacles. While we all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? In Adrian's case, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. No single approach - whether dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes - can solve this alone. The key lies in combining all these methods.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is an excellent concept - not just for native Spanish speakers, but for all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. While some fear this approach wastes resources or won't benefit the majority of students, this is incorrect. If we implemented these programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would benefit. Does this mean requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual teaching assistants and tutors to support this approach.",
            "From childhood on, most of us are told that there is something greater than ourselves, greater than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school, others go to temple, or search for answers within themselves. Many of us readily accept the religions passed down to us by our parents. Some, however, reject them completely, denying that there could be anything beyond the knowable in our own egocentric universe. We might adopt one value system, only to later change our minds and replace it with another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives on spirituality. We search for a light in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof above while smoking our cigarettes together. The gutters channeled the rain down, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely from his frame. His hair had thinned too, sparser than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to tell my father how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the falling rain in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, but kept him alive a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't determine the value of this when it merely prolonged his suffering. What kind of God would do this, I wondered. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I thought, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI hadn't wanted to watch him pass from this life into another. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to witness the ending of the life that had created mine. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily a farmer, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man known for his commitment and candor in matters of personal liberty and governance. His devotion to an agricultural system formed the foundation for virtually all his views on government. His efforts to preserve and promote what he considered the most noble of all professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nHe believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, free from the constraints of established traditions, thus enabling true self-governance. Taylor held strong convictions about natural human rights, arguing that these rights were interconnected—if one was compromised, all would eventually fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. Therefore, these rights should remain beyond government reach. He argued against what some termed the \"state of nature,\" where physical strength and cunning intelligence prevailed, asserting that civilization must operate differently.\n\nTaylor maintained that an effective government must acknowledge both the virtuous and corrupt aspects of human nature. He held firm to his dualistic view of morality, asserting that \"Since government is administered by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified positive principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and limiting capitalism, believing that a government founded on such principles would function justly regardless of its leadership, which he saw as inevitably driven by self-interest and greed. While he viewed self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it harmful only when it led to the formation of privileged groups thriving at others' expense.\n\nAs a dedicated Republican of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored a highly limited federal government, restricted to powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical. However, he warned against overly literal interpretation, arguing that understanding the framers' intent was crucial to prevent corruption. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, as it more clearly depicted the United States as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "Downward I gazed, my mind barely processing the sight before me. With detached precision and practiced awareness, I analyzed the scene, refusing to connect it to any deeper meaning. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, appearing and vanishing almost instantaneously. My mind worked with such fluid efficiency that it seemed I wasn't truly thinking, just experiencing what lay before me.\n\nOnce, following an artist's recommendation, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since age six, I'd wanted to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to how the brain processes visual information. One key technique involved placing a frame around the subject, transforming complex scenes - like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room - into manageable, focused compositions.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't mentally impose such a frame. The sight before me was too overwhelming, too striking in its crude reality. While Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, here I stood, facing what could only be called my \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers gripped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved, transforming intention into action in what might have been my most memorable creative moment, though not for the reasons I'd ever imagined. Water swirled peacefully, crystal clear at first. Particles separated and drifted away. With increasing urgency, my hand pushed the handle again, but the stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the toilet's bottom, unmoved and defiant.\n\nStanding there in my work uniform, green tie uncomfortably tight, mop in hand, I contemplated this unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron of Rite Aid's restroom.

Then, like a cook retrieving a roast from the oven, I steeled myself for the unpleasant task ahead...",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives behind the wheel. Multiple factors combine to create this deadly statistical pattern for America's youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem lies in the fact that the adolescent brain is literally not prepared for the dangers of driving. Lack of experience is also at the core of the problem. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also results in higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and running off the road.\n\nTeenagers face significantly greater risks when traveling with their peers—something anyone with common sense knows happens regularly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study demonstrating a clear correlation between passenger age and traffic accident frequency.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to enhance teen driver safety by implementing provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minor passengers. However, in my view, provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical measures, simply unable to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common tendency among those under 19-20 to seek risks purely for the thrill.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to postpone driving until this thrill-seeking tendency begins to diminish. If we continue issuing licenses to young teens, we'll not only continue to witness deadly accidents but likely see the death toll rise to alarming levels in coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby-Boomers will be eligible to drive, putting millions of new teen drivers on the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue could be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit system could remain in place before granting full licenses, along with required practical training hours. These requirements could be based on existing state standards (California, for instance, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Since teen driving statistics show similar patterns across all states, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and potentially effective approach to protecting teens nationwide.\n\nThis legislative proposal is not a new concept.",
            "This paper addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a brief definition of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is explained, including common characteristics and warning signs. Finally, the paper discusses ways in which teachers can support students with CAPD in an integrated classroom setting.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes how effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In specific terms, it refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that generates electrophysiological auditory potentials. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities but are not considered hearing impaired; rather, the brain regions responsible for processing auditory input, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, do not function typically.\n\nThe condition was first documented in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961, which established a model explaining the physiology of auditory perception. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: affected individuals may struggle with sound localization, difficulty distinguishing between multiple sound events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking, difficulty synthesizing sound information meaningfully, and problems processing the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis requires systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. The assessment may involve questionnaires, behavioral observation, and various auditory skill evaluations. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool with consistent success rates, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many diagnostic procedures involve testing the patient's ability to differentiate between simultaneous auditory stimuli, while advanced methods include measuring acoustic responses within the ear.",
            "In pursuing my studies in social work, I aim to build a career with the Department of Family and Children Services to assist abused or neglected children and support troubled families. The values I can bring to social work include: service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving relationships between others, and commitment to my own professional development to maintain competence in my field. These core values aren't just important for social workers; they're personally important to me.\n\nI've always wanted to help others, though I was uncertain about my career path. During my high school and college years, I witnessed many people running from their problems, with some using less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. These experiences led me to pursue a psychology degree. Still uncertain about my career direction, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy sitting on her couch. She explained he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents' house. Wanting to help, I drove to his parents' home. There, I privately shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was nothing legally they could do for the teenager. The parents appeared nervous and made excuses to explain their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality and mourn those we've lost, yet our concept of \"individuality\" often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing true uniqueness. I am an individual who refuses to limit myself to conform to others' expectations. Throughout my academic years, I protested against social injustice in various ways: dying my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that expressed my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, openly participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models as they relate to the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects, while the sociocultural models examine environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and elaborates on selected research findings to better explain the models. The research explanations and their findings are then analyzed critically to identify their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as either a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder connected to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other conditions. Primary sleep disorders are classified as either Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional categories of sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance use. The Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both lasting for at least one month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are sleep disorders characterized by behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for about two and a half years now, equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls - practically the easternmost point of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The journey from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in State College's frequently adverse weather conditions.\n\nSpeaking with a recent alumnus, I discovered that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast stretches of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with athletic fields, major new buildings including the new Creamery and health services facility, and is surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What's the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, the bicycle alone isn't the solution - students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure needs to accommodate cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after several years. He wondered why he'd ever stopped, saying, \"Bicycles are fantastic - there was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A simple breakfast and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. Purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas building, normally a twenty-five-minute walk from my residence. By bicycle, I can reduce this to just 5 minutes with sufficient effort. The only challenge is that Pollock Road, while the most direct route to Thomas building from my home, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on foot or by bicycle. While walking has its merits, my schedule is too demanding for it to be practical. Without my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable option for reaching classes. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes of my time - over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all the other walking time for various classes, appointments, and other commitments, and it amounts to more time than I can afford to spend.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of both technology and capitalistic structures through the creation of a dystopia in \"Brave New World.\" In this world, community value supersedes individualism, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. The population serves as mere pawns in a greater scheme, confined within an ideology dictated by the World Controller. When analyzing the work through Marxist theory, one can observe the author's underlying skepticism regarding the development of these systems. Common Marxist concepts such as homogeneity and reification reinforce the notion that Huxley's novel serves as commentary on the flaws in his era's emerging economy.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The general populace remains ignorant of their true economic relationship with other classes, focused solely on personal gain. This results from ideological control of the proletariat and workers, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning in Brave New World. The lower classes - Delta, Gamma, and others - lack genuine free will; through hypnopaedia, their drive to consume, spend, and indulge is artificially enhanced. This manipulation stems from the World Controller's authority. Hegemony - the complete domination of social classes by a select group - is evidently at play. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the system. The upper classes possess awareness of this reality but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard take meaningful action. Indeed, the class interactions serve as powerful indicators of capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nGenuine interpersonal relationships are nonexistent in Brave New World. Characters lack depth, even among protagonists, perhaps suggesting Huxley's view that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of free will and expression. Love is absent, as are extreme emotions; instead, interactions remain superficial, illustrated by men's focus on women's physical attributes and women's casual discussion of their encounters. Moreover, each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to communal roles mirrors Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islamic studies course at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more pertinent today than ever before. Looking back at events since 9/11, I have personally witnessed mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I doubt that in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has clear Muslim connections in his family background.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, the biography contradicts Muhammad's personality. From my previous knowledge and studies, I had understood that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the Islamic faith. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as something of a martyr, misunderstood by others and displaying humility, after which people gradually recognized the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nMoreover, there are remarkable parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' The most striking example is when he supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This writing style suggests to me that the authors wanted to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived in truth and miracles. This kind of narrative particularly troubles me as it seems to diminish Jesus Christ's miracles and life. It appears as though they're appropriating Jesus' life and character through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts that seem intended to provide 'witness testimony' or examples of people who 'independently' converted to Islam. However, these stories often come from third-hand sources - tales passed down through multiple people. I found this problematic because while it was meant to validate the stories' authenticity, it actually made them less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle man. Historical accounts contradict this portrayal of Muhammad as gentle and humble, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his convictions during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the development of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history in broad strokes, we see Christianity trending increasingly away from its origins. Today's world shows an ever-increasing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditional people remain and will resist thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow tremendously in the coming years. A desire will emerge to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of the religion's founder. Though it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: There will be a great reversal in Christian history's trajectory. There will be a return to its original form. A movement will grow that strips away layers of doctrine, one after another, as if time were moving backward, until only Jesus's original divine message to humanity remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as in Jesus's time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong as a guide. However, as the theological clock turns backward, Christianity's extreme diversity will consolidate into greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities rather than differences. Human history is full of such great reversals. Consider how Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our nation has progressed from enslaving African-Americans to having African-American leadership. The coming great reversion will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. Crucially, this process will be enabled by reading Jesus's words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has transpired since Jesus's lifetime? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. Monotheism, the concept of divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Jewish population was not unified, being divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe \"The Jungle\" demonstrates how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered at their core. They are solely focused on looking after themselves and optimizing their own lives, while showing no concern for those beneath them. \"The Jungle\" illustrates this in numerous ways, most notably through the behavior of factory owners and managers. Their singular focus is on expanding their companies and factories to their maximum potential, showing complete disregard for anyone or anything that stands in their way or suffers due to their progress. According to Upton Sinclair's depiction, the industrial landscape dominated the sky with its stark buildings and towering chimneys, spewing endless streams of smoke into the distance - a powerful image of environmental devastation and corporate indifference.\n\nThe owners and managers showed equal disregard for the workers who generated their wealth. They would take any measure to increase profits or reduce costs, creating an environment that was \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where human value was consistently subordinate to financial gain. Workers faced arbitrary layoffs without notice or compensation, endured grueling hours, and worked in dangerous conditions without any legal protections or safety regulations. Though never explicitly stated, the residents of Packingtown were expected to silently endure both the horrific working conditions in the factories and the squalid living conditions surrounding them. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than helped the workers they claimed to represent. The working population, largely comprised of poor immigrants, existed in a state comparable to slavery, perpetually teetering on the edge of starvation and subject to the whims of employers who proved as ruthless as slave drivers of the past. Under such a system, moral degradation became not just likely but inevitable.",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain that the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil's use of the term is certain, there is a more contemporary source that deserves recognition. Poe had a strong interest in German authors.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. In his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt notes the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he drinks heavily and weeps remembering his dead queen. Deciding his time has come, he bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The King of Thule's disposition and the king's portrayal in Dream-Land bear striking similarities, perhaps representing a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and reliance on alcohol.\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works: once as \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker depicts Thule's landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by deceased friends, viewing a colorless, shadowed world. These scenes parallel \"The King of Thule,\" where the protagonist has lost his wife, experiences isolation, and loses his will to rule or live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was an influential author whom Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his respect for Tennyson. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions that followed the original publication.",
            "Under California law, the question arises whether a customer who was injured after slipping on spilled applesauce in a grocery store could be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted maliciously, given that he was notified twice about the spill but failed to have it cleaned for thirty minutes while he was having his dinner.\n\nThe judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damages claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the likely harm of leaving a spill uncleaned, especially given that multiple D&D customers had suffered slip-and-fall injuries in previous months. While her argument about the despicable nature of Martin's actions may be less compelling, it remains reasonable considering that six similar incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still failed to implement proper safety measures.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager Paul Martin about an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin, who was on his dinner break, dismissed the matter, stating he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. It's worth noting that five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D during 2009. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nUnder California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded for non-contractual obligations if the defendant's actions demonstrated \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful or, lacking direct intent, \"despicable\" and executed with \"willful and conscious disregard for others' rights or safety.\" California courts have interpreted malicious conduct as actions taken with conscious disregard when the defendant \"was aware of the likely dangerous consequences of their behavior and willfully failed to avoid those consequences.\"",
            "She had always sensed something was missing in her life. It was an unfulfillable longing that persisted. It began when she was around 14, just entering her teenage years, and remained with her three years later at 17. By then, she had realized she was searching for someone rather than something. Yet no boys caught her interest. Several had been drawn to her, making awkward attempts to court the un-courtable, but none appealed to her. She often questioned this peculiar situation, trying to understand what could cause such an unusual circumstance in a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced theories, but none satisfactory enough to seriously consider. So she continued living, constantly examining her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed people who never quarreled with each other and, surprisingly, rarely argued with their daughter. Their only conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Though born to serene parents, she balanced their calm nature with her vibrant and engaging personality, making her well-liked, especially combined with her inherent kindness.\n\nThis day, however, was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking fresh inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice cry out from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic-stricken, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, taking short, pained breaths. \"Honey,\" her mother managed between gasps, \"I need... hospital.\" The words came out strained, and her daughter could see she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just show me where I can lift you.\" Her mother guided her hands, and at that moment, the household's hero was thankful for her strength training classes. She carried her mother to the car, carefully laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital visit brought familiar scents of antiseptic and illness, tinged with anxiety. But she noticed none of this, focused entirely on helping her mother. She rushed in carrying the injured woman, calling urgently for medical help. Concerned staff quickly gathered, bringing a gurney where they placed her mother. They whisked her away for immediate examination, leaving her daughter to wait in worried solitude.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepstool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with lower risks of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet represents a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but encompassing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats) and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention trial demonstrated the Mediterranean diet's superiority over low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese subjects. However, earlier studies had not specifically examined stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, comprising approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study accounted for potential confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe findings revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by higher aMed scores, was associated with reduced risk of both CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares that Hitler lives in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by an oppressive military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, several street demonstrations erupted, marking the first public protests in ten years. These protests, led by numerous Burmese monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began taking interest, and while the Burmese government initially reluctantly permitted the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, the situation soon escalated into what some viewed as outright warfare between the monks and the military regime, with forces actively raiding and pillaging monasteries throughout the country. Foreign journalists were immediately arrested, with Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for witnessing a street protest. While official figures cite 13 deaths, Colonel Hla Win, who deserted the army days before the official report, stated, \"The death toll in recent days far exceeds what's been reported. The number of bodies runs into thousands.\"\n\nThis pattern is nothing unprecedented. While these represent some of the most recent examples of worldwide atrocities, governments' desires to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their populations have existed throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection for complete authority over their society. Japanese emperors were considered divine beings, supposedly sent to guide their people toward prosperity through developments like Motorola phones and ritual suicide, while our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly discussions with Ted Haggard, who leads Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nAmong the most notorious examples are the June 4th, 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where scholars, workers' rights activists, and students gathered to oppose authoritarian rule. Casualty figures vary dramatically, with official Chinese government reports claiming 200-300 deaths, while Chinese Red Cross reports indicate 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s represents another instance, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically eliminated Tutsis and political moderates regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's Third Reich, spanning multiple years and countries, during which Jewish people were systematically rounded up and killed, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his longevity and, consequently, his creative ability to shape his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his brilliance as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated passages that leveraged band members' unique styles to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he enhanced the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinctive and cohesive sounds tailored to each piece. His masterful understanding of individual musicians' sounds and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz history's most groundbreaking works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's sonic innovation, particularly referencing Creole Love Call as an example of his pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work demonstrates his skill in using vocals to add depth and color without relying on lyrics, while showcasing his ability to complement his soloists' styles - a trait evident throughout his musical journey. This measured twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\n[Chorus descriptions remain essentially the same, with minor stylistic variations]\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice as a tonal element in this piece exemplifies a stylistic signature that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with his keen sense for tonal color. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending Miley's vocal-like playing with Cox's instrumental-style vocals. This approach evolves further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a cornerstone of his orchestra, introducing the melody with his distinctive muted trombone style.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson declared in 1917 that \"even now zoologists have barely begun to dream of defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" the same holds true today. In recent times, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk shell formation through both individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help illuminate the mechanisms involved in the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes.\n\nA shell can be understood as a tube-like structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral revolutions of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line known as the suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The apex marks the spire's tip, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"standard\" orientation shows the shell in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls begins by viewing the shell from above and identifying where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and are measured to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It's possible to track the aperture's path using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically, allowing for parameter variation and modification of mollusk shell development once mathematically formulated.",
            "The infant and child mortality rate in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is progressing toward achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the improvement rates for child and maternal health fall far short of the progress needed to meet their 2015 targets. The various reasons for these deficiencies will be discussed below, suggesting a need to strengthen the healthcare system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has shown progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this category still includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in cases of complicated pregnancies (explaining the high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). In essence, the improvements in this particular indicator are somewhat deceptive, and considerable work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by healthcare professionals. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area is also problematic, with low rates throughout the country.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%. These rates also highlight another concerning disparity: while urban areas show a 7% c-section rate, rural areas only show 2%. This underscores the issue of inequitable healthcare coverage across the country. Healthcare services are clearly concentrated in urban areas. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. The poor evidently face greater difficulties accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to most effectively address the service gap. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing exclusively on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches to address the above issues are appealing, as they offer more targeted, manageable objectives and typically yield faster results, there are important drawbacks to consider. A major concern is that heavy investment in one particular health sector often depletes funding for other areas and attracts human resources away from other essential services (as seen in the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs leads to service duplication and lack of coordination, resulting in increased bureaucracy and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded so dramatically over the last century that it now encompasses such a vast array of genres that creating a definitive list has become nearly impossible. Adding to this complexity, virtually all genres—including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, to name just a few—have generated multiple sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres within their respective domains.\n\nHeavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably evolved into one of popular music's most diverse and expressive genres over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though it tends to gravitate toward darker themes. Its diversity emerged shortly after the genre's inception, when artists began to recognize and exploit its inherent flexibility, creating distinct sub-genres that continued to branch into further subdivisions—a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has become so nuanced and fragmented that defining its exact nature has become challenging. While it has absorbed influences from numerous other genres, it maintains its own distinct origins. To truly comprehend today's omnipresent metal music, one must understand both the metal movement itself and why it constitutes a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be viewed as a \"music of excess\"—greater bass, increased volume, enhanced violence, and heightened theatricality. It eschews primitivism in favor of technical proficiency; metal musicians are notably skilled instrumentalists, a quality that clearly manifests in their music. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, which led to the creation of increasingly experimental, otherworldly recordings. Metal embraces dark, visceral qualities that were relatively uncommon in popular music of the time, and later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era.\n\nThe example of Helter Skelter demonstrates the Beatles' darker side, portraying an up-and-down journey often associated with drug use. Some consider this song one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, created as a response to a similarly heavy Rolling Stones song. The Beatles, seeking to prove they could match the Stones' intensity, included it on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dream-like works, the artist Henri Rousseau was already carefully shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman overwhelmed by the wonders of the land she visits in her dream but also represents Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. From the beginning of his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, finding himself confronted with a difficult internal dilemma in pursuing this goal. \"The Dream\" is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his lifelong inner struggle: whether to conform to or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to allow himself to develop creatively independent and unique, forging his own path as he went.\n\nBefore analyzing The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Rousseau came from a middle-class background, his father being a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed modest prosperity. Having received no formal artistic training, he worked until the age of forty as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) for France, though he was mistakenly nicknamed douanier (customs inspector). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one surviving child, a daughter named Julia, and profound grief. He sought refuge in a new life through painting, which offered him solace and fresh beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasant life in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk painter who embodied the hopes and dreams of his social class.",
            "Many great thinkers have proposed an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" Much of our life's knowledge comes through education or experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics without these conventional teaching methods.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore importantly, critiques of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. While we might discuss the Mona Lisa in terms of foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, these elements alone don't explain what makes it great art. People often preface their analysis of favorite artworks or literature with \"There's just something about it\" before delving into more detailed explanations. I believe both art and morality resist complete reduction to their component qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Something transcendent always remains beyond our descriptions of literature, and I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is perhaps the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, creating a bridge between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely intertwined because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use Kant's terminology. They affect us in ways we can experience but cannot fully explain. This connection is particularly strong in literature. As McKean observes, literature's distinctive feature is its moral quality. While moral standards might not apply to other arts like music, they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living inherently involves values, and literature's significance lies precisely in the values we discover within it.",
            "Today's Germany is regarded as a powerful force, a unified nation with its own cultural blend stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This same culture can be experienced from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's heartland to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given such a distinctive culture, it's not surprising that the Germany we know today emerged from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the German people. The origin of its name remains highly contested among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed the name came from a Germanic tribe then known as the Tungrians, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battle with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought against Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine with hostile intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin remains uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gallic language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continuously at war... They engage with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can serve as a useful tool for sustaining extended deceptions, one must ultimately shed this newly adopted facade or risk losing their true self in the process. A significant challenge in ending such deception lies in the potential alienation that follows. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their authentic self or maintaining their relationships with others.\n\nThe issue of deception through gender role reversal proves particularly complex, raising numerous questions - chief among them being the motivation behind such transformations. In Viola's case, her disguise clearly serves as a means of self-preservation, as evidenced when she states: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in foreign territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection, though this choice isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. Her convincing performance as a man leads to complicated romantic entanglements, particularly with Olivia's mistaken affections and her own suppressed feelings for Orsino.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can catalyze the emergence of hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. While some might question whether Olivia's attraction to Cesario suggests deeper implications about her sexuality, it seems more likely that Shakespeare used this situation to satirize the superficiality of attraction based purely on appearances. This interpretation is supported by how readily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest.",
            "German colonial rule has been criticized by various observers for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Herero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Naturally, such a vast colonial empire cannot be characterized by such a simple description. The German colonial empire exhibited as much diversity in its policies and governing style as it did in its geography. Educational opportunities across the colonies were equally varied. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Cameroon and other colonies also received praise from contemporary authors.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (today's Namibia) stood in sharp contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and took a leading role in native education, in South West Africa the education of indigenous peoples was left almost entirely to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did, however, invest considerable resources in educating European settlers, establishing state schools and providing stronger support and regulation for missionary schools serving the white population. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies could boast significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the vast majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's divergent experience. This study aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors, with particular emphasis on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German and date from the early twentieth century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in colonial educational systems. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa most directly addresses this paper's topic. Cohen compares the educational systems of both colonies and examines factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, South West Africa's large settler population explains many distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of the region consists of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico exemplify two nations that were once caught in a lasting rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The pinnacle of this conflict was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other confrontations occurred between the two nations, finally subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes over religion, culture, traditions, and significant material interests.\n\nThis pattern mirrors many other nations experiencing enduring rivalries with their neighbors. Countries sharing borders often face conflicting interests that lead to rivalries. The U.S.-Mexico case reflects a common pattern among neighboring nations with sustained conflicts. As David M. Pletcher (1977) noted, \"Only Mexico and Cuba presented persistent, overarching diplomatic challenges for America\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations' proximity to the United States contributed to their rival status, while other Latin American countries maintained generally positive relations.\n\nReligious differences created a divide between the nations, a common historical phenomenon. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, this rivalry centered on religious rather than political differences. The mutual distrust inherited from their former colonial powers - England and Spain - significantly hindered the development of friendly relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry. Most conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier challenges. Bandit attacks on American border towns remained problematic until both nations established stronger military presence along their borders.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States, and finally concluded when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness whose existence I had never known about.\n\nI was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply rooted need for security and safety that I lacked as a child. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So - even though my dream was to be a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old and single, with barely any savings and unable to work. To this day I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left to call my own. I get by, but each day is a battle that challenges my security, safety, and self-worth. While nothing in my life is certain anymore, one truth remains clear: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, regardless of how strong I was. And trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy message is that life will always bring emergencies - both major and minor. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are simply too great to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that we in the U.S. need to stop relying solely on big government - heaven knows that basket is moldy and falling apart anyway. But I'd much rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help one another and to ask for help - rather than each of us retreating to our backyards to build individual fallout shelters.\n\nAmerican Conservatives speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built this nation, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors through hard times wasn't individualism - it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of biological attack. I have multiple flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods too. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food - do it. It's an excellent idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're doing all that, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism—with its most orthodox branch known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion, now approximately twenty-five centuries old, appears quite different today than it did during Buddha's lifetime. This transformation is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which holds religious significance, despite Buddha never having taught about such festivities. These variations extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological essence of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has needed to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by forces both external and internal, hostile and benign.\n\nVarious qualifying terms are essential to this discussion. The concept of internal versus external forces is key: internal forces emerge from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—arising from negative perceptions of Buddhism. A benign force neither intends to help nor harm the Buddhist community, though it may inadvertently do either. These distinctions will be referenced throughout this discussion.\n\nTo understand these changes, one must first grasp the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily contained within the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka encompasses Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these concepts is crucial for ending Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara comes the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) through enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes life's rules: five precepts for laypeople (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks follow numerous additional disciplinary rules. At Buddhism's doctrinal core lie the four noble truths, beginning with Dukkha—the truth that life contains suffering, followed by the understanding that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a vital role in every negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually is and represents. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a specific thing. It is also not uniform or standardized. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently too general and overly simplified. While understanding cultural generalizations has its place, it is more productive for a negotiator to understand the relevance of a culture to the current situation and how that culture's attitudes can and will influence the discussions. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in relation to one's own culture, and comparisons inevitably arise.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve everything from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must accept it for what it is and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations, and particularly when coming to the table from a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when a negotiator finds themselves in foreign territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can only help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Most companies within a nation develop their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize extended working hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture manifests in dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, task delegation), and recruitment practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to company-approved charities or fundraisers. The variations in American corporate culture from company to company (including regional differences and urban-suburban distinctions) demonstrate the diversity of thought possible within a particular societal culture. Some cultures may appear more uniform than American culture to outsiders, but similar appearances often indicate a need to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly crucial to understand as they reveal the underlying motivations of a culture. In cultures that prioritize saving face or community harmony, a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed at negotiations. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't necessarily rush to reach an agreement. While considering these general principles is important before negotiations begin, a negotiator benefits from understanding their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiation.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart: 'There is no God.'\" This quotation first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and stands at the beginning of St. Anselm's argumentation regarding God's existence. This conviction appears to be shared by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Since their arguments both address the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, proceed from their shared correct belief in God's existence, specifically the God of the Bible. To consider a god-like figure that might not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not allow us to properly compare their arguments, as they are essentially defending one specific conception of God. With this in mind, I would propose that while both present valid points, neither provides a truly comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, let us first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a journey of gaining understanding through faith, looking inward to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of His non-existence. While this concept, expressed in his terminology, is somewhat cumbersome and occasionally unclear, the essential message is that proof of God resides within one's own mind. St. Anselm suggests that we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own soul to find truth about God; rather, His existence is proven simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. External evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is no irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to in Christian texts as faith.\n\nThis approach differs markedly from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead proposes that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. Such an approach would be advantageous in evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without depending on their willingness to accept unprovable assertions. They could instead be convinced through pure logic. St. Thomas develops five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially demonstrates that proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God's existence. It's like being told you're missing one puzzle piece and assembling the rest - logic allows you to know the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers regarding important themes. Some of these techniques prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs many of these different techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" At times, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject for his readers. In other instances, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald applies this latter technique to various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald constructs meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later employs these meanings to evoke specific emotional associations with important objects in readers' minds.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald establishes and uses for white/gray represents uniformity, with white suggesting a more refined and upper-class quality, while gray indicates something more aged and faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the novel's beginning through consistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" - indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick in his \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom in his \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine \"powdered milky white.\" The only exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to common, unremarkable elements: Nick travels through \"white chasms of lower New York,\" the names at Gatsby's parties become \"gray names,\" and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - all suggesting uniformity.",
            "San Diego County demonstrates remarkable agricultural productivity, owing to its mild, sun-rich climate. The region produces a diverse array of crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, fruit trees such as peach and lemon, berries, honey, and peppers. The San Diego area features a robust market for organic community-supported agriculture, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and dairy products enjoy significant popularity. Many organic farms extend their offerings beyond agriculture, providing guided tours of their operations and allowing access for hiking, bird watching, and various recreational pursuits. This operational model enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat quality, facilitating recreational use, and creating revenue opportunities through farm tours and educational programs.\n\nBeyond serving a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming typically promotes greater biodiversity in both flora and fauna due to the absence of chemical inputs in soil and water systems. However, organic farming does present certain increased costs compared to conventional methods. It demands more intensive labor and management for pest control, weed removal, and natural soil fertilization, often experiencing higher crop losses than conventional farming, while small organic operations lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, though not strictly tied to organic farming, may incur extra labor costs, including cover crop cultivation, planned grazing rotation, invasive species management, and deliberate vegetation management to create specific habitat features like edge environments or open ground areas. These factors explain why landowners might seek financial assistance or expert guidance in optimizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe selected property for this scenario comprises 160 acres adjacent to Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, featuring chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, currently under review, encompasses over a hundred plant and animal species, including endangered species like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as potentially soon-to-be-listed species such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis land carries a rich history, having been home to Native American peoples for centuries before transitioning to cattle ranching and firewood production in the late 1800s. Originally established through a homestead patent, the property likely served grazing and wood production purposes for many decades. The property was identified through real estate listings, with subsequent research into available government programs to explore realistic options for small farmers interested in cost mitigation and wildlife conservation. A local organic farm serves as a model for potential agricultural approaches on this land.",
            "There exists a connection between brothers - an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within this connection lie numerous emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name but a few. Brothers understand each other on a level that surpasses any other relationship of this kind, and they can truly see themselves only when looking at their brother. It is during the most desperate situations that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether for good or ill. When these emotions surface, they bring with them a hefty price. Understanding the emotions that stem from this fraternal connection means confronting their consequences. When one looks into a brother's eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their genuine character manifests in their actions and the consequences thereof.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme and all the turbulent emotions that accompany it. Against a richly detailed, vibrant backdrop, these two boys embark on what proves to be a futile journey. In the story's climactic moment, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, their interactions, and through the narrator's perspective, which conveys both the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his worldview - both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be traced back to a single driving emotion: pride. From his first outings with his younger brother Doodle until their final, fatal encounter, the protagonist harbors resentment toward Doodle. He had yearned for a brother he could teach his worldly skills to, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted someone to \"race to Horsehead Landing\" and \"perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn.\" Given Doodle's condition, these activities were clearly impossible. Doodle was born with a severely weak heart, making his survival doubtful, let alone participation in strenuous physical activities. What a crushing disappointment for the young protagonist, whose head was filled with wild dreams, to have them shattered in an instant. His anger toward the small child even manifested in thoughts of suffocation with a pillow - a disturbing consideration for a child. Yet, when the small child smiled at him, his heart softened. Such a simple gesture gave the protagonist such hope, suggesting his darker impulses weren't deeply rooted. Deep down, he possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate, creative information processing system. As technology progressed from primitive to modern forms, the metaphors used to describe the brain evolved accordingly. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a papyrus scroll, then to a book, and most recently to a computer. When studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limited utility and can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries - where colors change significantly across short distances - to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions made during bottom-up processing to accelerate your recognition of the box, helping you identify it as a solid black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. While your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your feet, a properly functioning attention filter prevents you from consciously noting each one. Conversely, you might detect your name being called even in a crowded, noisy environment. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nInformation storage precedes processing in the brain. Several memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is first encoded, with different encoding methods for various sensory inputs. Verbal information, for example, can be encoded structurally (appearance of written words), phonemically (sound of words), or semantically (meaning of words). Stored information must then be maintained. Research with animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, operates through electrical signals cycling through specific neural circuits. Long-term memory storage is believed to involve structural changes in certain proteins.\n\nMultiple models exist to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval studies, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which in turn links to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most significant corporations were left in ruins. This recession's effects continue to be felt today, prompting us to examine how this crisis occurred and how we can prevent similar situations in the future. In essence, the financial crisis emerged from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that pushed banks and firms to issue subprime loans within an already inadequate financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves, spreading this turmoil throughout the repackaged mortgages they had sold and into the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis had its origins in 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought re-election by boosting his popularity. The Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, Fannie Mae, the nation's leading mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage accessibility to low and moderate-income borrowers while simultaneously satisfying shareholders' demands for continued profit growth. Holmes presciently warned that this government-subsidized corporation might face difficulties during an economic downturn, potentially requiring government intervention similar to the savings and loan industry rescue in the 1980s.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of complex mortgage structures. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the pre-crisis years deeply entangled various economic sectors with the housing market. This led American households and financial markets to become overly invested in housing, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing approximately 30% of U.S. GDP. The aftermath saw Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's forced conversion to commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That moment in your story where you spread your little writer's wings and take off, aiming to impress everyone with your captivating, indeed magical prose. Or it's the part where your readers fall asleep and/or click the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known for yelling at her screen when she finds herself drowning in too much information, and not even in the entertaining way.\n\nExposition isn't your ally.\n\nWhile our dear readers are familiar with the fundamental writing principle \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin still catches herself writing lengthy passages where either nothing happens, or worse, too much happens. Exposition is like that little devil perched on your shoulder, suggesting you get all the background information out of the way to reach the good parts (not to be confused with that other devil on your opposite shoulder, urging you to share every minute detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially telling your audience what occurred, typically through straightforward prose. In films, exposition happens when one character downloads a heap of information onto another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. When reading a story, you might be told about how the heroine met her beloved, their grand wedding, and his subsequent murder before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be condensed into two pages with only two lines of dialogue each. Instead, you'd expect the author to develop the husband's character, revealing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife, while showing through various means how his presence transformed and enriched her life. A proper character introduction would allow readers to form an emotional connection to his fate while gaining insight into the heroine's character: what attracted her to him, the depth of their bond, and glimpses of her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his perspective. You would share in her grief at his loss, thereby forming a stronger connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance beyond the basic plot points of \"They met, they married, he died.\"",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story concerned a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife. While her name wasn't disclosed, he was identified as Shad Hostettler. They showed his police photograph, and he had an absolutely sinister appearance. They dedicated only about two minutes to this developing story. The only details provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I believe they allocated an appropriate amount of time to this story.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, age 18. He was critically wounded in the Sharon Woods area, with no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was conducting the investigation. The coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might have been related to the victim being African-American or the incident occurring in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed over the years that minority victims often receive minimal coverage. When a white person, whether child or adult, becomes a victim of crime or goes missing, the media provides extensive coverage; minority victims, however, often barely receive mention.\n\nThe subsequent story detailed a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided information about the suspected location of the incident. Investigators determined it was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nFollowing this was a weather report predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures expected to remain in the low to mid-eighties. Though brief, this appeared to be used as a teaser to maintain viewership.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall and weighing around one hundred fifty pounds. The coverage seemed to place unusual emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone.\n\nThe final story concerned Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, they expressed his sentence as \"300 months\" rather than twenty-five years, perhaps to make it sound more severe. They also mentioned his Hispanic ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of index funds with the advantages of individual stock ownership, including the ability to short sell, use margin trading, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. While these advantages are highly attractive, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks, such as having to pay trading commissions on ETF transactions, just as with stocks. Another advantage is the wide range of available ETF options. Although these benefits are clearly outlined, prudent financial investors should always evaluate whether claimed benefits, such as diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning the single ETF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten individual stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better Sharpe ratios or returns.\n\nTo make the evaluation manageable, we've chosen to focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The top 10 holdings and their respective asset percentages are listed below.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the entire IHF ETF, we can normalize their asset percentages to 100% and calculate each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in proportions matching the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the complete ETF. These initial findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower risk. However, we must consider whether these differences in means are statistically significant.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance between these portfolios, we calculated the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalized to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. The onset of winter at a New England campus naturally leads to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which might explain part of this decline. December coincides with the fall semester's conclusion, when everyone is overwhelmed with completing coursework, processing grades, and other end-of-term responsibilities. Many people may have simply forgotten about submitting their commuter logs during this busy time. Moreover, December brings the holiday season and its accompanying month-long break for students and faculty, during which many have no reason to visit campus at all. When classes resume in late January, this might also explain the low submission numbers for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for February's low submission rate. One could theorize that such projects typically experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a focused campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. Thus, we faced the dual challenge of maintaining project momentum against both natural engagement decline and the specific interruptions caused by academic breaks and holidays.\n\nA fundamental challenge for this project (and any alternative transportation initiative) lies in people's deep-seated attachment to the freedom, independence, and flexibility that personal vehicles provide. This is fundamentally woven into our cultural fabric. Consequently, providing compelling incentives for alternative commuting becomes crucial. While we distributed numerous prizes including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage services, independent bookstores, and national retailers, it would have been interesting to explore the impact of more substantial rewards – such as a premium bicycle, hybrid vehicle, or electric car. Such prizes might have helped prevent the participation decline we experienced. Since our prize structure remained constant throughout the project, implementing escalating prize values might have proved beneficial. While the initial gift cards seemed sufficient at the project's start, announcing more substantial prizes like bicycles in December and perhaps a hybrid or electric car in January might have sustained or even increased participation rather than seeing it decline.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I reviewed all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically employ creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the common artistic elements found in most trick films while also exploring the unique evolutionary characteristics that emerged in some later works. Generally speaking, trick films at the turn of the century were characterized by set-based filming, frontal proscenium composition, stationary camera work, long and medium shots, and adherence to the principle of one shot equaling one complete film. However, some productions from the early twentieth century began challenging these conventions by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films is their interior set filming within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera maintains a fixed position rather than following the movement of people or objects. This compositional approach, deeply rooted in theatrical traditions and particularly influenced by vaudeville and magic performances, was widespread in early cinema. The stage-based format resulted in characters typically moving only laterally, rarely approaching or retreating from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors enter from stage right and move horizontally across the frame, with the camera remaining stationary even when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style naturally led to the predominance of long shots and occasional medium shots. None of the Edison catalog's trick films employed close-up shots, reflecting the theatrical viewing experience where audiences observed the entire stage performance within the confines of the proscenium arch. As was typical in early cinema, performers stayed in the middle ground, never approaching the camera for close-up effects.\n\nMost early trick films followed the convention of one conceptual shot comprising the entire film. This approach limited most productions to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frame rate, and restricted their narrative scope. The majority featured brief vaudeville-style illusions, such as magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that what appears as one continuous shot to viewers often consisted of multiple physical shots cleverly joined to create illusions. This is evident in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), where careful observation reveals the splice point where the shot of Mary's \"decapitation\" was inserted, though the film appears as one continuous take to the casual viewer.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" represents, both in substance and name, an \"oxymoron of 'Old-New'\" as Ian Watt explains in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has experienced both contempt and admiration, facing accusations of superficiality while being celebrated for its evocation of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre and create a novel form of literary expression. Walpole combines \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' naturalistic approaches found in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws upon medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" had already been applied to various peoples, styles, and historical periods. It was often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" social and literary \"progress.\" What has allowed Gothic literature to endure and remain simultaneously antiquated yet fresh to readers far removed from its origins is its unique combination of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's innovative format, which offers intimate insights into character psychology.\n\nOne of the most significant gothic elements present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry and knightly training is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, emphasized chivalry because it represented an ideal - the quintessential knight: brave, honorable, and capable - which they perceived as lacking in their contemporary society. Through the incorporation of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing Gothic literature's evolution into Romanticism) and serves as a tool for contemporary social critique. Walpole, writing during politically turbulent times and facing personal struggles, may have believed that the moral integrity and inherent \"goodness\" of the gothic era had somehow disappeared from his contemporary society. This theme is evident in several characters, notably Frederic, who embodies numerous chivalric traits and is portrayed through traditional knightly imagery, though with the characteristic Gothic tendency toward excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management represents the flow of processes that move goods from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution stages until they reach the customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently. A supply chain consists of six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these six key elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the foundation and initial step in the supply chain process. It defines the when, why, where, and how of all manufacturing activities. Managers must understand customer preferences, primarily by analyzing market trends - the most significant indicator of customer demand. Once managers have assessed the market and comprehended customer demands, they can determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities. They then select appropriate production facilities based on volume capabilities and quality standards, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The next phase involves scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production represents a crucial step in the supply chain process, where every detail matters. Improper planning could result in significant time and financial losses. For instance, from my experience at Walmart and Target, these retailers maintain detailed protocols for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, ensuring smooth operations through clear directives and expectations.\n\nThe second key element, supply, encompasses strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A single product may involve multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and expertise. Managers must determine which division best suits different production processes and may opt to outsource certain operations. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity - the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",

            "A few years ago, I worked as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary school students. I did my best to help them in any subject they struggled with, though my strengths were in English and reading. One of the teachers recruited me to help a young boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was having significant difficulties with reading. I realized something wasn't quite right; he was experiencing the most unusual problems. He could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others were completely foreign to him - it was quite puzzling. While he was clearly of Latino heritage and spoke perfect English, we continued to struggle until I met his mother. One day, while supervising a few remaining students during a field trip day, his mother came in. She didn't speak any English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish knowledge (I was just learning), we managed to communicate. That's when it hit me like lightning: Adrian could read perfectly well, he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier challenges in schools, particularly in California, and to demonstrate that these issues aren't always obvious. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can present significant obstacles. While we all acknowledge this problem exists, what's the solution? In Adrian's case, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. No single approach - whether dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes - can solve this alone. The key lies in combining all these methods.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is an excellent concept - not just for native Spanish speakers, but for all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. While some fear this approach wastes resources or won't benefit the majority of students, this is incorrect. If we implemented these programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would benefit. Does this mean requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual teaching assistants and tutors to support this approach.",
            "From childhood on, most of us are told that there is something greater than ourselves, greater than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school, others go to temple, or search for answers within themselves. Many of us readily accept the religions passed down to us by our parents. Some, however, reject them completely, denying that there could be anything beyond the knowable in our own egocentric universe. We might adopt one value system, only to later change our minds and replace it with another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives on spirituality. We search for a light in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof above while smoking our cigarettes together. The gutters channeled the rain down, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely from his frame. His hair had thinned too, sparser than I remembered. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to tell my father how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the falling rain in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, but kept him alive a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't determine the value of this when it merely prolonged his suffering. What kind of God would do this, I wondered. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I thought, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI hadn't wanted to watch him pass from this life into another. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to witness the ending of the life that had created mine. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily a farmer, this profession combined with his brief political career shaped him into a man known for his commitment and candor in matters of personal liberty and governance. His devotion to an agricultural system formed the foundation for virtually all his views on government. His efforts to preserve and promote what he considered the most noble of all professions influenced his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nHe believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, free from the constraints of established traditions, thus enabling true self-governance. Taylor held strong convictions about natural human rights, arguing that these rights were interconnected—if one was compromised, all would eventually fail, diminishing the value of those remaining. Therefore, these rights should remain beyond government reach. He argued against what some termed the \"state of nature,\" where physical strength and cunning intelligence prevailed, asserting that civilization must operate differently.\n\nTaylor maintained that an effective government must acknowledge both the virtuous and corrupt aspects of human nature. He held firm to his dualistic view of morality, asserting that \"Since government is administered by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He identified positive principles as those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and limiting capitalism, believing that a government founded on such principles would function justly regardless of its leadership, which he saw as inevitably driven by self-interest and greed. While he viewed self-interest as humanity's universal motivator, he considered it harmful only when it led to the formation of privileged groups thriving at others' expense.\n\nAs a dedicated Republican of his era, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation. He favored a highly limited federal government, restricted to powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical. However, he warned against overly literal interpretation, arguing that understanding the framers' intent was crucial to prevent corruption. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, as it more clearly depicted the United States as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "Downward I gazed, my mind barely processing the sight before me. With detached precision and practiced awareness, I analyzed the scene, refusing to connect it to any deeper meaning. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, appearing and vanishing almost instantaneously. My mind worked with such fluid efficiency that it seemed I wasn't truly thinking, just experiencing what lay before me.\n\nOnce, following an artist's recommendation, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since age six, I'd wanted to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from basic pencil handling to how the brain processes visual information. One key technique involved placing a frame around the subject, transforming complex scenes - like a fruit bowl in a kitchen connected to a dining room - into manageable, focused compositions.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't mentally impose such a frame. The sight before me was too overwhelming, too striking in its crude reality. While Picasso had his Blue Period, Monet his gardens, and Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes, here I stood, facing what could only be called my \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers gripped my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved, transforming intention into action in what might have been my most memorable creative moment, though not for the reasons I'd ever imagined. Water swirled peacefully, crystal clear at first. Particles separated and drifted away. With increasing urgency, my hand pushed the handle again, but the stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the toilet's bottom, unmoved and defiant.\n\nStanding there in my work uniform, green tie uncomfortably tight, mop in hand, I contemplated this unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron of Rite Aid's restroom. After several more futile flushes and moments of philosophical reflection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled a makeshift protective glove. Then, like a cook retrieving a roast from the oven, I steeled myself for the unpleasant task ahead...",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives behind the wheel. Multiple factors combine to create this deadly statistical pattern for America's youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem lies in the fact that the adolescent brain is literally not prepared for the dangers of driving. Lack of experience is also at the core of the problem. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also results in higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and running off the road.\n\nTeenagers face significantly greater risks when traveling with their peers—something anyone with common sense knows happens regularly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study demonstrating a clear correlation between passenger age and traffic accident frequency.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to enhance teen driver safety by implementing provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minor passengers. However, in my view, provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical measures, simply unable to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common tendency among those under 19-20 to seek risks purely for the thrill.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to postpone driving until this thrill-seeking tendency begins to diminish. If we continue issuing licenses to young teens, we'll not only continue to witness deadly accidents but likely see the death toll rise to alarming levels in coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby-Boomers will be eligible to drive, putting millions of new teen drivers on the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue could be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 would be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit system could remain in place before granting full licenses, along with required practical training hours. These requirements could be based on existing state standards (California, for instance, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice). Since teen driving statistics show similar patterns across all states, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and potentially effective approach to protecting teens nationwide.\n\nThis legislative proposal is not a new concept.",
            "This paper addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a brief definition of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is explained, including common characteristics and warning signs. Finally, the paper discusses ways in which teachers can support students with CAPD in an integrated classroom setting.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes how effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In specific terms, it refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that generates electrophysiological auditory potentials. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities but are not considered hearing impaired; rather, the brain regions responsible for processing auditory input, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, do not function typically.\n\nThe condition was first documented in the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" during studies of children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961, which established a model explaining the physiology of auditory perception. A significant national conference in 1977 sparked increased research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: affected individuals may struggle with sound localization, difficulty distinguishing between multiple sound events, inability to recognize sound patterns, challenges in detecting vocal nuances (such as sarcasm), auditory masking, difficulty synthesizing sound information meaningfully, and problems processing the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis requires systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. The assessment may involve questionnaires, behavioral observation, and various auditory skill evaluations. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool with consistent success rates, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many diagnostic procedures involve testing the patient's ability to differentiate between simultaneous auditory stimuli, while advanced methods include measuring acoustic responses within the ear.",
            "In pursuing my studies in social work, I aim to build a career with the Department of Family and Children Services to assist abused or neglected children and support troubled families. The values I can bring to social work include: service, respect, ethical conduct, dedication to improving relationships between others, and commitment to my own professional development to maintain competence in my field. These core values aren't just important for social workers; they're personally important to me.\n\nI've always wanted to help others, though I was uncertain about my career path. During my high school and college years, I witnessed many people running from their problems, with some using less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. These experiences led me to pursue a psychology degree. Still uncertain about my career direction, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy sitting on her couch. She explained he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents' house. Wanting to help, I drove to his parents' home. There, I privately shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was nothing legally they could do for the teenager. The parents appeared nervous and made excuses to explain their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality and mourn those we've lost, yet our concept of \"individuality\" often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing true uniqueness. I am an individual who refuses to limit myself to conform to others' expectations. Throughout my academic years, I protested against social injustice in various ways: dying my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that expressed my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, openly participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural models as they relate to the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects, while the sociocultural models examine environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and elaborates on selected research findings to better explain the models. The research explanations and their findings are then analyzed critically to identify their specific strengths and limitations.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as either a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder connected to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other conditions. Primary sleep disorders are classified as either Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional categories of sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance use. The Dyssomnias include: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both lasting for at least one month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are sleep disorders characterized by behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for about two and a half years now, equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be challenging. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls - practically the easternmost point of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The journey from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in State College's frequently adverse weather conditions.\n\nSpeaking with a recent alumnus, I discovered that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast stretches of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with athletic fields, major new buildings including the new Creamery and health services facility, and is surrounded by apartment complexes. As our campus continues to grow, transportation between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What's the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, the bicycle alone isn't the solution - students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure needs to accommodate cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had returned to cycling after several years. He wondered why he'd ever stopped, saying, \"Bicycles are fantastic - there was a period when cycling wasn't considered cool, but it's really the most practical way to get around.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A simple breakfast and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. Purchasing a bicycle was my wisest decision this year. I have daily classes in Thomas building, normally a twenty-five-minute walk from my residence. By bicycle, I can reduce this to just 5 minutes with sufficient effort. The only challenge is that Pollock Road, while the most direct route to Thomas building from my home, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on foot or by bicycle. While walking has its merits, my schedule is too demanding for it to be practical. Without my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable option for reaching classes. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes of my time - over two and a half hours weekly. Factor in all the other walking time for various classes, appointments, and other commitments, and it amounts to more time than I can afford to spend.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of both technology and capitalistic structures through the creation of a dystopia in \"Brave New World.\" In this world, community value supersedes individualism, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. The population serves as mere pawns in a greater scheme, confined within an ideology dictated by the World Controller. When analyzing the work through Marxist theory, one can observe the author's underlying skepticism regarding the development of these systems. Common Marxist concepts such as homogeneity and reification reinforce the notion that Huxley's novel serves as commentary on the flaws in his era's emerging economy.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The general populace remains ignorant of their true economic relationship with other classes, focused solely on personal gain. This results from ideological control of the proletariat and workers, clearly demonstrated through the conditioning in Brave New World. The lower classes - Delta, Gamma, and others - lack genuine free will; through hypnopaedia, their drive to consume, spend, and indulge is artificially enhanced. This manipulation stems from the World Controller's authority. Hegemony - the complete domination of social classes by a select group - is evidently at play. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the system. The upper classes possess awareness of this reality but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard take meaningful action. Indeed, the class interactions serve as powerful indicators of capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nGenuine interpersonal relationships are nonexistent in Brave New World. Characters lack depth, even among protagonists, perhaps suggesting Huxley's view that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of free will and expression. Love is absent, as are extreme emotions; instead, interactions remain superficial, illustrated by men's focus on women's physical attributes and women's casual discussion of their encounters. Moreover, each social class's acceptance of their hierarchical position reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to communal roles mirrors Marxist observations about the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islamic studies course at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more pertinent today than ever before. Looking back at events since 9/11, I have personally witnessed mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I doubt that in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has clear Muslim connections in his family background.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, the biography contradicts Muhammad's personality. From my previous knowledge and studies, I had understood that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the Islamic faith. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as something of a martyr, misunderstood by others and displaying humility, after which people gradually recognized the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nMoreover, there are remarkable parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles.' The most striking example is when he supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This writing style suggests to me that the authors wanted to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but simply lived in truth and miracles. This kind of narrative particularly troubles me as it seems to diminish Jesus Christ's miracles and life. It appears as though they're appropriating Jesus' life and character through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography contains numerous accounts that seem intended to provide 'witness testimony' or examples of people who 'independently' converted to Islam. However, these stories often come from third-hand sources - tales passed down through multiple people. I found this problematic because while it was meant to validate the stories' authenticity, it actually made them less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle man. Historical accounts contradict this portrayal of Muhammad as gentle and humble, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his convictions during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the development of Christian thought after his death. Looking at this history in broad strokes, we see Christianity trending increasingly away from its origins. Today's world shows an ever-increasing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendencies. While traditional people remain and will resist thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow tremendously in the coming years. A desire will emerge to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of the religion's founder. Though it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome is inevitable: There will be a great reversal in Christian history's trajectory. There will be a return to its original form. A movement will grow that strips away layers of doctrine, one after another, as if time were moving backward, until only Jesus's original divine message to humanity remains, before other thinkers made their interpretations. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, inspiring masses to worship as in Jesus's time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong as a guide. However, as the theological clock turns backward, Christianity's extreme diversity will consolidate into greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities rather than differences. Human history is full of such great reversals. Consider how Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our nation has progressed from enslaving African-Americans to having African-American leadership. The coming great reversion will unfold within Christianity, undoing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. Crucially, this process will be enabled by reading Jesus's words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has transpired since Jesus's lifetime? Looking far enough back, we find only Judaism, Christianity's theological foundation. Monotheism, the concept of divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion when Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Jewish population was not unified, being divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe \"The Jungle\" demonstrates how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered at their core. They are solely focused on looking after themselves and optimizing their own lives, while showing no concern for those beneath them. \"The Jungle\" illustrates this in numerous ways, most notably through the behavior of factory owners and managers. Their singular focus is on expanding their companies and factories to their maximum potential, showing complete disregard for anyone or anything that stands in their way or suffers due to their progress. According to Upton Sinclair's depiction, the industrial landscape dominated the sky with its stark buildings and towering chimneys, spewing endless streams of smoke into the distance - a powerful image of environmental devastation and corporate indifference.\n\nThe owners and managers showed equal disregard for the workers who generated their wealth. They would take any measure to increase profits or reduce costs, creating an environment that was \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where human value was consistently subordinate to financial gain. Workers faced arbitrary layoffs without notice or compensation, endured grueling hours, and worked in dangerous conditions without any legal protections or safety regulations. Though never explicitly stated, the residents of Packingtown were expected to silently endure both the horrific working conditions in the factories and the squalid living conditions surrounding them. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than helped the workers they claimed to represent. The working population, largely comprised of poor immigrants, existed in a state comparable to slavery, perpetually teetering on the edge of starvation and subject to the whims of employers who proved as ruthless as slave drivers of the past. Under such a system, moral degradation became not just likely but inevitable.",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain that the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil's use of the term is certain, there is a more contemporary source that deserves recognition. Poe had a strong interest in German authors.\n\nThis reference is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. In his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt notes the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Following her death, he drinks heavily and weeps remembering his dead queen. Deciding his time has come, he bequeaths all his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The King of Thule's disposition and the king's portrayal in Dream-Land bear striking similarities, perhaps representing a dark mirror of Poe's own loss and reliance on alcohol.\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works: once as \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker depicts Thule's landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by deceased friends, viewing a colorless, shadowed world. These scenes parallel \"The King of Thule,\" where the protagonist has lost his wife, experiences isolation, and loses his will to rule or live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was an influential author whom Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his respect for Tennyson. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions that followed the original publication.",
            "Under California law, the question arises whether a customer who was injured after slipping on spilled applesauce in a grocery store could be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted maliciously, given that he was notified twice about the spill but failed to have it cleaned for thirty minutes while he was having his dinner.\n\nThe judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damages claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the likely harm of leaving a spill uncleaned, especially given that multiple D&D customers had suffered slip-and-fall injuries in previous months. While her argument about the despicable nature of Martin's actions may be less compelling, it remains reasonable considering that six similar incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still failed to implement proper safety measures.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager Paul Martin about an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin, who was on his dinner break, dismissed the matter, stating he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. It's worth noting that five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D during 2009. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nUnder California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages may be awarded for non-contractual obligations if the defendant's actions demonstrated \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful or, lacking direct intent, \"despicable\" and executed with \"willful and conscious disregard for others' rights or safety.\" California courts have interpreted malicious conduct as actions taken with conscious disregard when the defendant \"was aware of the likely dangerous consequences of their behavior and willfully failed to avoid those consequences.\"",
            "She had always sensed something was missing in her life. It was an unfulfillable longing that persisted. It began when she was around 14, just entering her teenage years, and remained with her three years later at 17. By then, she had realized she was searching for someone rather than something. Yet no boys caught her interest. Several had been drawn to her, making awkward attempts to court the un-courtable, but none appealed to her. She often questioned this peculiar situation, trying to understand what could cause such an unusual circumstance in a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced theories, but none satisfactory enough to seriously consider. So she continued living, constantly examining her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically peaceful. Her parents were gentle, composed people who never quarreled with each other and, surprisingly, rarely argued with their daughter. Their only conflicts arose from her assertions of independence and free spirit. Though born to serene parents, she balanced their calm nature with her vibrant and engaging personality, making her well-liked, especially combined with her inherent kindness.\n\nThis day, however, was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking fresh inspiration, she heard her mother's beautiful voice cry out from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic-stricken, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, taking short, pained breaths. \"Honey,\" her mother managed between gasps, \"I need... hospital.\" The words came out strained, and her daughter could see she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just show me where I can lift you.\" Her mother guided her hands, and at that moment, the household's hero was thankful for her strength training classes. She carried her mother to the car, carefully laid her in the back seat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital visit brought familiar scents of antiseptic and illness, tinged with anxiety. But she noticed none of this, focused entirely on helping her mother. She rushed in carrying the injured woman, calling urgently for medical help. Concerned staff quickly gathered, bringing a gurney where they placed her mother. They whisked her away for immediate examination, leaving her daughter to wait in worried solitude.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepstool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with lower risks of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet represents a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but encompassing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats) and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and overall cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rates. An intervention trial demonstrated the Mediterranean diet's superiority over low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese subjects. However, earlier studies had not specifically examined stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year study period. FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital documentation, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, comprising approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs. The study accounted for potential confounding factors by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy, multivitamin use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe findings revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by higher aMed scores, was associated with reduced risk of both CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up, researchers documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares that Hitler lives in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a cardboard sign above her head with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by an oppressive military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, several street demonstrations erupted, marking the first public protests in ten years. These protests, led by numerous Burmese monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began taking interest, and while the Burmese government initially reluctantly permitted the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, the situation soon escalated into what some viewed as outright warfare between the monks and the military regime, with forces actively raiding and pillaging monasteries throughout the country. Foreign journalists were immediately arrested, with Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for witnessing a street protest. While official figures cite 13 deaths, Colonel Hla Win, who deserted the army days before the official report, stated, \"The death toll in recent days far exceeds what's been reported. The number of bodies runs into thousands.\"\n\nThis pattern is nothing unprecedented. While these represent some of the most recent examples of worldwide atrocities, governments' desires to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their populations have existed throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection for complete authority over their society. Japanese emperors were considered divine beings, supposedly sent to guide their people toward prosperity through developments like Motorola phones and ritual suicide, while our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly discussions with Ted Haggard, who leads Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nAmong the most notorious examples are the June 4th, 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where scholars, workers' rights activists, and students gathered to oppose authoritarian rule. Casualty figures vary dramatically, with official Chinese government reports claiming 200-300 deaths, while Chinese Red Cross reports indicate 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s represents another instance, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically eliminated Tutsis and political moderates regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's Third Reich, spanning multiple years and countries, during which Jewish people were systematically rounded up and killed, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's jazz legacy stems largely from his longevity and, consequently, his creative ability to shape his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence remains understated in many of the compositions discussed here, his brilliance as a composer shone through in creating rich, intricate pieces that highlighted his band members' individual talents. He expertly crafted frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated passages that leveraged band members' unique styles to emphasize musical themes. In doing so, he enhanced the orchestra's overall tonality, creating distinctive and cohesive sounds tailored to each piece. His masterful understanding of individual musicians' sounds and their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz history's most groundbreaking works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's sonic innovation, particularly referencing Creole Love Call as an example of his pioneering use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work demonstrates his skill in using vocals to add depth and color without relying on lyrics, while showcasing his ability to complement his soloists' styles - a trait evident throughout his musical journey. This measured twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\n[Chorus descriptions remain essentially the same, with minor stylistic variations]\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice as a tonal element in this piece exemplifies a stylistic signature that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, he masterfully combines precise orchestration with his keen sense for tonal color. The interplay between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich harmony by blending Miley's vocal-like playing with Cox's instrumental-style vocals. This approach evolves further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a cornerstone of his orchestra, introducing the melody with his distinctive muted trombone style.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson declared in 1917 that \"even now zoologists have barely begun to dream of defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" the same holds true today. In recent times, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk shell formation through both individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help illuminate the mechanisms involved in the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes.\n\nA shell can be understood as a tube-like structure that travels through 360 degrees of space over time. These spiral revolutions of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line known as the suture separates each whorl. In most shells, the final whorl (body whorl) is the largest. The spire comprises all whorls except the last one. The apex marks the spire's tip, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"standard\" orientation shows the shell in an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls begins by viewing the shell from above and identifying where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and are measured to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It's possible to track the aperture's path using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically, allowing for parameter variation and modification of mollusk shell development once mathematically formulated.",
            "The infant and child mortality rate in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is progressing toward achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the improvement rates for child and maternal health fall far short of the progress needed to meet their 2015 targets. The various reasons for these deficiencies will be discussed below, suggesting a need to strengthen the healthcare system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has shown progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this category still includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in cases of complicated pregnancies (explaining the high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage). In essence, the improvements in this particular indicator are somewhat deceptive, and considerable work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by healthcare professionals. While postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area is also problematic, with low rates throughout the country.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%. These rates also highlight another concerning disparity: while urban areas show a 7% c-section rate, rural areas only show 2%. This underscores the issue of inequitable healthcare coverage across the country. Healthcare services are clearly concentrated in urban areas. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. The poor evidently face greater difficulties accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to most effectively address the service gap. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing exclusively on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches to address the above issues are appealing, as they offer more targeted, manageable objectives and typically yield faster results, there are important drawbacks to consider. A major concern is that heavy investment in one particular health sector often depletes funding for other areas and attracts human resources away from other essential services (as seen in the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs leads to service duplication and lack of coordination, resulting in increased bureaucracy and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded so dramatically over the last century that it now encompasses such a vast array of genres that creating a definitive list has become nearly impossible. Adding to this complexity, virtually all genres—including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, to name just a few—have generated multiple sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres within their respective domains.\n\nHeavy Metal rock, in particular, has arguably evolved into one of popular music's most diverse and expressive genres over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though it tends to gravitate toward darker themes. Its diversity emerged shortly after the genre's inception, when artists began to recognize and exploit its inherent flexibility, creating distinct sub-genres that continued to branch into further subdivisions—a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has become so nuanced and fragmented that defining its exact nature has become challenging. While it has absorbed influences from numerous other genres, it maintains its own distinct origins. To truly comprehend today's omnipresent metal music, one must understand both the metal movement itself and why it constitutes a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement characterized by darkness. It can be viewed as a \"music of excess\"—greater bass, increased volume, enhanced violence, and heightened theatricality. It eschews primitivism in favor of technical proficiency; metal musicians are notably skilled instrumentalists, a quality that clearly manifests in their music. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, which led to the creation of increasingly experimental, otherworldly recordings. Metal embraces dark, visceral qualities that were relatively uncommon in popular music of the time, and later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era.\n\nThe example of Helter Skelter demonstrates the Beatles' darker side, portraying an up-and-down journey often associated with drug use. Some consider this song one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, created as a response to a similarly heavy Rolling Stones song. The Beatles, seeking to prove they could match the Stones' intensity, included it on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dream-like works, the artist Henri Rousseau was already carefully shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman overwhelmed by the wonders of the land she visits in her dream but also represents Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. From the beginning of his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, finding himself confronted with a difficult internal dilemma in pursuing this goal. \"The Dream\" is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his lifelong inner struggle: whether to conform to or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to allow himself to develop creatively independent and unique, forging his own path as he went.\n\nBefore analyzing The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Rousseau came from a middle-class background, his father being a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed modest prosperity. Having received no formal artistic training, he worked until the age of forty as a gabelou (municipal toll collector) for France, though he was mistakenly nicknamed douanier (customs inspector). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one surviving child, a daughter named Julia, and profound grief. He sought refuge in a new life through painting, which offered him solace and fresh beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasant life in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk painter who embodied the hopes and dreams of his social class.",
            "Many great thinkers have proposed an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" Much of our life's knowledge comes through education or experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics without these conventional teaching methods.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore importantly, critiques of art or morality can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. While we might discuss the Mona Lisa in terms of foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, these elements alone don't explain what makes it great art. People often preface their analysis of favorite artworks or literature with \"There's just something about it\" before delving into more detailed explanations. I believe both art and morality resist complete reduction to their component qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Something transcendent always remains beyond our descriptions of literature, and I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein observes, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is perhaps the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, creating a bridge between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely intertwined because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use Kant's terminology. They affect us in ways we can experience but cannot fully explain. This connection is particularly strong in literature. As McKean observes, literature's distinctive feature is its moral quality. While moral standards might not apply to other arts like music, they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living inherently involves values, and literature's significance lies precisely in the values we discover within it.",
            "Today's Germany is regarded as a powerful force, a unified nation with its own cultural blend stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This same culture can be experienced from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's heartland to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given such a distinctive culture, it's not surprising that the Germany we know today emerged from various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the German people. The origin of its name remains highly contested among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed the name came from a Germanic tribe then known as the Tungrians, who were called Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battle with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought against Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine with hostile intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin remains uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gallic language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continuously at war... They engage with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can serve as a useful tool for sustaining extended deceptions, one must ultimately shed this newly adopted facade or risk losing their true self in the process. A significant challenge in ending such deception lies in the potential alienation that follows. Thus, one must ultimately choose between preserving their authentic self or maintaining their relationships with others.\n\nThe issue of deception through gender role reversal proves particularly complex, raising numerous questions - chief among them being the motivation behind such transformations. In Viola's case, her disguise clearly serves as a means of self-preservation, as evidenced when she states: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nFinding herself in foreign territory, Viola adopts a male persona for protection, though this choice isolates her from potential female allies and support networks. Her convincing performance as a man leads to complicated romantic entanglements, particularly with Olivia's mistaken affections and her own suppressed feelings for Orsino.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can catalyze the emergence of hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. While some might question whether Olivia's attraction to Cesario suggests deeper implications about her sexuality, it seems more likely that Shakespeare used this situation to satirize the superficiality of attraction based purely on appearances. This interpretation is supported by how readily Olivia transfers her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola as family rather than a romantic interest.",
            "German colonial rule has been criticized by various observers for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Herero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Naturally, such a vast colonial empire cannot be characterized by such a simple description. The German colonial empire exhibited as much diversity in its policies and governing style as it did in its geography. Educational opportunities across the colonies were equally varied. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Cameroon and other colonies also received praise from contemporary authors.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (today's Namibia) stood in sharp contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and took a leading role in native education, in South West Africa the education of indigenous peoples was left almost entirely to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did, however, invest considerable resources in educating European settlers, establishing state schools and providing stronger support and regulation for missionary schools serving the white population. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies could boast significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the vast majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's divergent experience. This study aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors, with particular emphasis on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German and date from the early twentieth century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in colonial educational systems. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa most directly addresses this paper's topic. Cohen compares the educational systems of both colonies and examines factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, South West Africa's large settler population explains many distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of the region consists of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico exemplify two nations that were once caught in a lasting rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The pinnacle of this conflict was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States defeated Mexico and acquired Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other confrontations occurred between the two nations, finally subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes over religion, culture, traditions, and significant material interests.\n\nThis pattern mirrors many other nations experiencing enduring rivalries with their neighbors. Countries sharing borders often face conflicting interests that lead to rivalries. The U.S.-Mexico case reflects a common pattern among neighboring nations with sustained conflicts. As David M. Pletcher (1977) noted, \"Only Mexico and Cuba presented persistent, overarching diplomatic challenges for America\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations' proximity to the United States contributed to their rival status, while other Latin American countries maintained generally positive relations.\n\nReligious differences created a divide between the nations, a common historical phenomenon. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"while 20th-century Americans opposed fascism and communism, their 18th and 19th-century counterparts opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to how the Cold War combined ideological differences with competition over vital interests, this rivalry centered on religious rather than political differences. The mutual distrust inherited from their former colonial powers - England and Spain - significantly hindered the development of friendly relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry. Most conflicts involved territorial issues, particularly border raids and frontier challenges. Bandit attacks on American border towns remained problematic until both nations established stronger military presence along their borders.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico became increasingly economically dependent on the United States, and finally concluded when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness whose existence I had never known about.\n\nI was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply rooted need for security and safety that I lacked as a child. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So - even though my dream was to be a scientist or journalist - preferably both - I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old and single, with barely any savings and unable to work. To this day I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left to call my own. I get by, but each day is a battle that challenges my security, safety, and self-worth. While nothing in my life is certain anymore, one truth remains clear: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, regardless of how strong I was. And trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy message is that life will always bring emergencies - both major and minor. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are simply too great to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that we in the U.S. need to stop relying solely on big government - heaven knows that basket is moldy and falling apart anyway. But I'd much rather see Americans learning to trust each other again - learning to help one another and to ask for help - rather than each of us retreating to our backyards to build individual fallout shelters.\n\nAmerican Conservatives speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built this nation, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors through hard times wasn't individualism - it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for windows in case of biological attack. I have multiple flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods too. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food - do it. It's an excellent idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're doing all that, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism—with its most orthodox branch known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion, now approximately twenty-five centuries old, appears quite different today than it did during Buddha's lifetime. This transformation is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which holds religious significance, despite Buddha never having taught about such festivities. These variations extend from superficial traditions to the soteriological essence of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has needed to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by forces both external and internal, hostile and benign.\n\nVarious qualifying terms are essential to this discussion. The concept of internal versus external forces is key: internal forces emerge from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—arising from negative perceptions of Buddhism. A benign force neither intends to help nor harm the Buddhist community, though it may inadvertently do either. These distinctions will be referenced throughout this discussion.\n\nTo understand these changes, one must first grasp the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily contained within the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka encompasses Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these concepts is crucial for ending Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara comes the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) through enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes life's rules: five precepts for laypeople (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks follow numerous additional disciplinary rules. At Buddhism's doctrinal core lie the four noble truths, beginning with Dukkha—the truth that life contains suffering, followed by the understanding that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome."
