            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation. It can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a specific entity. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding the generalizations of a culture is appropriate, it is far more productive for a negotiator to grasp the significance of a culture to the matter at hand and how that culture’s attitude can affect negotiations. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in a manner relatable to one's own culture, and comparisons naturally arise.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must accept it as it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the context of negotiation, and particularly if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, respecting traditions and beliefs when a negotiator is on \"foreign\" territory can only help to overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily confine itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a certain nation establish their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize long office hours or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others restrict it to “company-approved” charities or fundraisers. Observing differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, including urban to suburban environments) demonstrates the diversity of thought that can exist within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior simply indicates a need to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand because they provide the rationale behind a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is valued within a culture, a negotiator will certainly not publicly shame his company or superior to succeed at the negotiation table. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that places greater importance on hard-driven bargaining will not necessarily be inclined to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into account is crucial before one reaches the negotiating table. However, it is beneficial for a negotiator to learn something personal about his opponent to make the negotiation effective.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This belief seems to be shared by another author we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. Assuming a God-type figure different from the one in which our two authors believe would not allow us to adequately compare their arguments, as they essentially defend a specific concept of God. That said, I would suggest that while both present valid points, neither truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God. To illustrate this, we will first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith by looking within oneself for proof of God. He explains that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of his nonexistence. While this concept, when explained in his terms, is somewhat tedious and at times unclear, the main idea is that the proof of God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm suggests that we don't need to go beyond the confines of our soul to find the truth about God, but that the existence of this being is considered true simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting something without an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to in Christian texts as faith. This idea is quite different from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas proposes that the existence of God can be entirely proven through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. Such an idea would be advantageous in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Instead, they could be convinced by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you're told that you are missing a puzzle piece and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know the features and existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\"",
            "Many authors employ different methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects to their readers. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses a variety of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective with a noun that usually don't fit together to create a certain aura around a subject for the readers. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald builds meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a certain feeling around an important object for readers.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald develops and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being somewhat nicer and higher class, and gray being older and more faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the beginning of the novel through the constant use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\"—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gets his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by coloring many common, unimportant subjects with them: as Nick goes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—uniformity. He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough meaning, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something to readers first starts with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to see Daisy less as a character, more like a uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs more of this technique around Daisy to give the impression of her being a more uniform addition, for instance, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",

Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant market for food from organic, community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while improving habitats, permitting recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and other income-generating or educational activities.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in local plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming entails higher costs than conventional farming in some respects. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of large-scale operations. Practices not associated with organic farming but beneficial to wildlife can also lead to higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open patches. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel next to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It comprises 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still under review but currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for countless centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production over many intervening decades.\n\nI selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore what options a small farmer might realistically have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable connection. Within this bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand each other far more than anyone else with such a bond, and they can only see themselves when they look at their brother. It is in the most critical situations that the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they come with a high cost. Part of understanding the emotions born from this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the resulting consequences is where their true character lies. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers explore this theme and all the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which strongly influence his actions.  \nThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the moment he and his little brother, Doodle, first set out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment toward Doodle. He wanted a brother to whom he could teach all his worldly skills, like “...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “...someone to race to Horsehead Landing... and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...” Obviously, these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making it unlikely that he would even survive. Even then, it was almost impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, whose head was filled with wild fantasies, to see all those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to harbor some anger toward the small child, as he recalls contemplating killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction was probably not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative system for processing information. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a papyrus sheet, then a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you study the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The brain’s algorithms repeatedly transform sensory information in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object’s borders—where the color changes significantly over a short distance—to determine that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made during some steps of bottom-up processing to speed up the recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and to which cognitive processes it should be made available. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to the appearance of the printed word, phonemically, referring to how the word sounds, or semantically, referring to the meaning of the word. Once stored, the information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was engulfed in a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most vital companies were left in ruins. This recession persists today, prompting the question: how did this crisis arise, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing subprime loans into an already immature and inadequate financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the entire economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces its roots back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term in office. He aimed to extend his presidency by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately foresaw the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors combined to send the economy into a nosedive, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets, in general, becoming over-leveraged in the housing market, leaving them highly vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at exceptionally low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, captivating everyone with your magnetic, even magical prose. Or the part where your readers doze off and/or hit the \"Back\" button while muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin is known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself overwhelmed by excessive details, and not even in an entertaining way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are already familiar with the basic writing principle, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy text passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much happens. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder suggesting that you clear the history to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder encouraging the author to disclose every tiny detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character delivers a dump of information to another, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a particular place and time, they married in grand fashion, and her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span two pages, during which both characters only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior how deeply he loves his wife, and similarly, you would anticipate the heroine to reveal in various ways how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later directly states this). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, thereby becoming more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect depth on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and proceeds*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush through certain aspects. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was once in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was \"live,\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mugshot, and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this developing story. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think the time they spent on this story was appropriate.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was critically injured; there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been because he was a \"black\" man or it was a black neighborhood. I have noticed (for years) that minorities are often overlooked when they are victims of a crime. If, for example, a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but if it’s a minority, it’s lucky if it’s even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story concerned the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They described him as about six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing that he was black and how dark-skinned he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I am not sure what the angle was, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic; I don’t believe that was really relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction. Although these benefits are highly attractive, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would with a stock order. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. Even though these benefits are clearly stated, it's always a good practice for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, indeed exist and to what extent. For this purpose, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 holdings that make up the ETF to determine if the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also to see if there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, including every holding would be quite unwieldy, so we have decided to include only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart above, it's evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It's also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed so far, it seems that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo assess whether these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was somewhat disheartening, and it's difficult to pinpoint the cause. With winter setting in at a New England campus, there's a noticeable drop in people commuting by bike or on foot, which may partly explain the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so on. Completing the commuter log might have simply fallen off the radar for many people. Additionally, December brings the start of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus at all. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which could also be a clue to the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully explain the low submissions for February. One might speculate that any project of this type experiences an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm that naturally wanes. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to revive the initiative, which did result in increased log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum in light of both a natural decrease in engagement and specifically the issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative commuting modes. We offered many prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. However, it would have been interesting to see how some even larger prizes might have affected participation—such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could also have helped to address the dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn't really change during the project. If the prizes had increased in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed more than adequate at the project's start, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only imagine that participation and engagement would have increased rather than decreased.",
            "I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901 in the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique evolutionary features found in a few of the later films. Primarily, the trick films at the turn of the century are bound to a set, composed in front of a frontal proscenium, show no camera movement, use long and medium shots, and adhere to the strict method of one shot equaling one film. However, some films from the early twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by the trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films and has roots in theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally move only side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they go out of frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that the shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-ups are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is borrowed from the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the edges of the stage. As in most early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, note that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually consist of several joined together to create the illusion of appearing or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in both substance and name. The Gothic style has been criticized, praised, accused of lacking real depth, and celebrated for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to invoke (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the original \"Gothic Novel,\" used ideas from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws on medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of its publication, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which offers the reader a personal view of the characters' psychology, allows Gothic to persist and be both obsolete and new to readers far removed from the original writing.\n\nA prominent gothic theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly important to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived lack of such ideals in society, as seen by writers like Walpole. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (hinting at Gothic's evolution to Romantic) to try to improve the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was in politically troubled times and despaired over the future. Engaged in politics and facing (arguably) unfair accusations, he might have thought that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" from the gothic era had been lost in the 'present' society. This concept is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Described as a prince who has suffered, affected by tragedy, and thought to have been killed by infidels, Frederic's portrayal includes many traditional chivalric images. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the flow of processes that move goods from the customer's order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling activities within the supply chain to efficiently fulfill customer needs. The supply chain is made up of six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers use to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production, which is the foundation of the entire process. It involves determining when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to understand customer desires, which can be gauged by analyzing the market, the primary indicator of customer demands. After understanding these demands, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They determine the best location for production based on volume and quality while ensuring customer satisfaction. Once the site is chosen, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail in production is critical, as any oversight can cost the company time and money. For instance, in my experience with Wal-Mart and Target, both companies have structured processes for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes allow the company to operate smoothly without confusion.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and the development of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have various production divisions for one product, each with different equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the division that best suits the product's processes. They might also outsource work to create speed, which is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their rich detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that are considered Victorian but diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both employ elements of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which is atypical for novels of that period, thereby strengthening the characters in each work, offering insights that elaborate on their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, as their very words echoed in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, he realized he was speaking to them... Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts rose into the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and tumult, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and function vary in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event as if in a dream while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the dire condition of his health, which was strongly present through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, as he cannot bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even when his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this section, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I did my utmost to assist them in any subject where they were struggling, though my strengths were in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a little boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade), who was having significant difficulties with reading. It struck me that something was amiss; he had the most peculiar issues. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others he couldn't at all, it was the strangest thing. You see, he was of Latino descent, that much I was certain, yet the boy spoke perfect English. We continued to struggle until the day I met his mother. I was helping to watch over a few stragglers (for lack of a better word) while the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my very poor Spanish (I was just learning), we managed to communicate. But then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read well, he just wasn't very familiar with the English alphabet. I don’t know if that realization helped him much in the end, but I do hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. I also share it to show that it's not always as obvious as one might think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still pose a major obstacle. I believe everyone can agree this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was fairly straightforward: tutoring in English reading, especially focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There isn't a single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key lies in combining all of these approaches!\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea. Not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There is a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources, and that the majority of children in schools will not benefit. But that's incorrect. If we applied these programs as the norm in classrooms, rather than the exception, all children would benefit. How do we achieve this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No. That would be unreasonable and somewhat unrealistic. However, I do think there’s no reason we can't have special aides, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there larger than we are, greater than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to the temple or search within themselves for answers. Many of us readily accept the religions handed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them completely, denying that there can be anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one set of values only to later change our minds and embrace another. Whatever path we choose, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality. We search for a light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof above us as we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters directed the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the kind of gaze that seemed half searching, half remembering. Over the past few months, he had grown thinner, and his clothes hung limply from his body. His hair had thinned, more sparse than I remembered. He continued to stare into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because discussing it would make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December of that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father's suffering but merely kept him alive a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; what value there was in him suffering longer, I could not define. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him transition from this life into another. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of Republicanism. Though primarily a farmer, his career, along with a brief stint in politics, made him known for his dedication and candidness on issues of personal freedom and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system was foundational to almost all his governmental views. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the superior profession colored his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to create an ideal system, free from native tradition that could hinder government creators, thus enabling self-government. He was firm in his belief in the natural rights of man, viewing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. These rights should thus be out of governmental reach. He argued that the \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and malevolent intelligence but insisted this should not be true in a civilized society.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for man's inherent good and evil. He was very firm in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (ibid., p. 167). Good principles, as he defined them, protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on such principles would function fairly, despite being inevitably led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest was, in his view, man's motivation in all things, considered evil only when it led beyond a society based on public good into sub-societies living at others' expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, requiring careful oversight to prevent adding bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely despotic. However, he also considered a simple, literal interpretation risky, as it could become corrupt without reference to the framers' intent. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, explicitly describing the country as a group of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I stared downward, my mind blankly processing the view before me. Without emotion, in silence, with a practiced awareness that observed but refused to connect the subject of study to any abstract understanding, my mind analyzed the scene before my eyes. Thoughts flowed into my mind and vanished again almost as quickly as they appeared. My consciousness worked so smoothly and cleanly that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I observed. \n\nOnce, on the advice of an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the brain processes involved in interpreting lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wants to study. This transforms an overwhelmingly detailed image, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into an easily comprehensible image, that bowl of fruit on a simple plane. \n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally project that artist's frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in amazement. Picasso went through his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of presenting my perspective as artistically valuable, then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown. \n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool of artistry, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will taking shape, which could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter separated from the whole and were carried away into nothingness. Muscles tightened, jerked and spasmed a bit more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand struck the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nMop loosely held in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly as I looked at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter that someone had left as a message for the fools who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying behind the wheel. Several factors combine to create this deadly statistical vector for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem is that the teenage brain is literally not ready for the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience is also at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and running off the road. Teens also fare much worse when traveling with peers, which anyone with common sense knows they regularly do. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur. California and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring provisional licenses that limit the hours teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers. But provisional driver's licenses are, in my opinion, merely stopgap measures. The real issue is that the youngest drivers, as a group, are simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities by all statistical measures. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has conducted research suggesting that those under 19-20 often have a desire to take risks just for the thrill of it. It makes sense then to delay driving at least until the tendency to seek thrills decreases. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, not only will we continue to see deadly accidents, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road. Legislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education courses to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, and a certain number of practical driving hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number already required by most states (in California, for example, this number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. The legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",
            "This article addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a brief definition of the disorder. Then, the diagnosis is explained, along with common traits or \"red flags.\" Finally, the article concludes with ways a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity supporting that processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This means it is a disorder where the central nervous system (i.e., the brain) cannot correctly process what is heard. People with CAPD can hear normally and are thus not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain area responsible for translating what we hear, separating words, or distinguishing conversations from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder, which became known as CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced \"dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: the affected person may not be able to localize or hear sounds in space; may struggle to discriminate between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not recognize sound patterns; may not differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm from a change in voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may lack the ability to synthesize sound cues (that is, interpret them in a meaningful way to act upon); and may not determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the patient must undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently used with a high diagnostic success rate, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "While pursuing an education in social work, I aim to follow a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected and to support troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical character, a commitment to improving relationships among others, and enhancing my professional skills to remain competent in my field. These core values are important not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others but was unsure of the career path I wanted to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I saw many people deny their problems, and some used less than ideal coping mechanisms. Because of situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain about a career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents’ home. To see if I could help, I drove to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and mentioned that I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents since the law could do nothing for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior in involving outside help for “simple” disputes. After this experience, I seriously began considering a career in social work to help children with “simple” family disputes.\n\nAnother important value for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important, and we mourn those we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy limiting myself to be similar to others. Throughout my high school and college years, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothes that matched my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional set, declaring my involvement with the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "The text examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic information and health-related medical aspects. Sociocultural models focus on environmental relationships and their impact on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and explains selected research to illustrate and clarify them. The research explanations and findings are critiqued for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary, related to another mental disorder, or linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to another mental disorder connect to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia entails trouble staying awake, lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias involve behavioral and/or physiological abnormalities. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disability). This review mainly focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice found phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for sleep/wake states. GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, whereas inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that mouse models can apply to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for human GABAB receptors. Issues or absence of this receptor could affect sleep quality without medication. If the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and receptor changes could naturally disrupt sleep, impacting school, career, and everyday tasks requiring focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be an issue. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is practically the furthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in far-off places like the Willard Building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. In a conversation with an alum close to my age, I learned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large areas of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, large new buildings, including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the mobility problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to meet the needs of cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently resumed cycling after several years. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus; just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have classes in the Thomas Building, which is easily a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest path to the Thomas Building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's over two and a half hours each week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, etc. That's more time than I can spare.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of technology and the capitalist structure, which is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in his novel \"Brave New World.\" The people value the community over the individual and are conditioned from the start to prioritize immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. When examining the work through the lens of Marxist theism, one can see the author's underlying suspicions regarding the development of these systems. Common Marxist terminology, such as homogeneity and reification, reinforces the idea that Huxley's novel comments on the flaws in the emerging economy of his time. Capitalism is satirized through the Marxist thesis of false consciousness. Essentially, the common people are prevented from knowing their true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are mainly interested in their own gain. This is said to be the result of the ideological control of the proletariat and ordinary workers, something quite evident through the conditioning of the people in \"Brave New World.\" The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopaedia, the drive to consume, spend, and indulge is heightened above all else. This is manipulated, as previously mentioned, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by a separate group of individuals in totality, is clearly used in this case. The lower classes are completely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing; few Alphas or Betas, apart from characters like Bernard, do more than simply accept their place. In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between different individuals do not exist in \"Brave New World.\" The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters – they are, even among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprives man of free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, distinctly portrayed through the men's remarks about women, primarily about their physical appearance (i.e., pneumatic quality), and the women's unabashed comments about their encounters, so to speak. Furthermore, each societal class's complacency with their status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their absolute obedience in their role in the community is a reflection of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority over all else as long as they continue to consume, obey, and stay in line with the rest of their peers.",
            "Almost four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. One of the primary topics of intense discussion in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is more relevant today than ever. Looking back at the events since 9/11, I've personally seen the mass media transition from a hostile perspective on Islam and extremists to a strong tolerance for Islam in America. I don't believe in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has evident Muslim roots in his family. The Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, it contradicts his personality. From what I previously learned, I thought Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt Islam. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is depicted as a martyr, misunderstood, who even humbled himself before others. Subsequently, people came one by one to recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out. There are also striking similarities between the works of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most evident is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it to be more than enough for forty men. This writing style suggests to me that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet who needed to prove nothing but lived in truth and miracles. This kind of fallacy is troubling because it undermines the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it feels like they are trying to steal and claim credit for Jesus' life and essence through Muhammad. There are also numerous stories in the biography aiming to provide evidence of 'witness' or self-initiated conversions to Islam. But the issue is that many stories are from a third-party perspective. The author notes hearing from someone who heard from another, etc. I didn't appreciate this because, although intended to validate the stories, I felt it diminished them and made them more suspicious. What bothers me most about this work is their attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the notion of Muhammad being gentle and humble, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today understand the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought that advanced after his life. If we look at this history broadly, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further from its origins. Today's world seems to show an increasing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and resist any kind of thinking beyond what they were taught, this portion of the population may not be influential enough to affect the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. A desire will spread to differentiate the doctrines added over time to Christianity from the actual intent of the religion's namesake. It might take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a major reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow numerically, removing layers of doctrine as if the clock were turning backward, until nothing remains except a concept of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if living in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will turn into increasing uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. One example is how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that \"The Jungle\" reveals how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered. They focus primarily on improving their own lives and ignore those below them. This is depicted in many ways throughout the book. The most obvious example is the behavior of the owners and managers of large factories. Their main goal is to make their businesses as large and profitable as possible, with no regard for anyone or anything that stands in their way or is harmed by their progress. Upton Sinclair describes it as: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the great harm caused by this pollution, emphasizing that the owners have no regard for anyone or anything that might be hurt. They don't care about the massive smoke plumes from the factories or the animal waste runoff from the numerous pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also disregarded their employees, who worked to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"So from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They forced their employees to work long, grueling hours and could lay off many people without warning, without any compensation or help finding new jobs. During the era \"The Jungle\" is set in, there were few, if any, laws or regulations to protect workers' safety or well-being. This allowed managers and owners to act freely, pushing their employees to speed up production and work in terrible conditions. Although the book doesn't say it directly, those who lived and worked to exhaustion in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions both at work and in their living environments. There were no agencies or organizations to provide information or assistance to workers. While unions existed, they often did more harm than good, profiting from the poor workers. The workers were treated so badly and trapped in the Packingtown system that they were described as slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil used the term, but there is a more recent source that deserves some credit. Poe was very interested in German authors. This quote is important because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe’s writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems, concluding that Poe imitated Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature states that Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death, 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him the gift of a goblet. After her death, he begins to drink heavily and cry from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and leaves his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, perhaps a dark counterpart to Poe’s loss and reliance on drinking. Faust was also turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once, Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, but he uses this phrase in \"Dream-Land\" twice, as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark and lonely, haunted by dead friends, and sees a shadowy world without color. All of these scenes could be read into Goethe’s \"The King of Thule\" as he has just lost his wife, is lonely, and has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. Goethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work through the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages by showing that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager had been informed twice of the spill and neglected to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from the conduct, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning up a spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping in the months before Palmer’s incident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, but still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or in the absence of intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and carried out with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt like she needed something. There was this desire that refused to be satisfied. It began when she was about 14, just entering her teenage years. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By then, she had realized she wanted someone rather than something. Yet, she felt no interest in any boys. Some had been drawn to her, going through awkward attempts to win over the unapproachable, but none appealed to her. She often questioned herself about this strange feeling, trying to understand what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of contemplation led to theories, but nothing substantial enough for her to ponder deeply. So she lived her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other, and strangely enough, arguments with their daughter were rare. The only disputes they had were about her asserting her independence and free spirit. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she certainly countered their energies with her vibrant and fun personality, which made her very likable, along with the fact that she was a kind person.\n\nToday, however, was not a calm day. As she moved from room to room, looking for new inspiration for herself, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She rushed into the room, beginning to panic as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the floor, appearing to be in pain as she kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to offer help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured with her hands, and at that moment, the household hero was very grateful she had taken strength classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her down in the back, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the smell of disinfectant and illness, mixed with fear. But she didn't notice it, as her mind was too focused on helping her mother. She quickly carried the injured woman inside and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed and laid her mother on it. They took her for immediate examination, and her daughter was left to sit and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, emphasizing higher intake of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, with reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies documented an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet for promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Earlier studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake in the prior year. More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onward, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During 20 years of follow-up, 2,391 incident cases of CHD, 1,763 incident cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard above her head, with the unsettling message scrawled onto her sign with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, several street protests occurred, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began to take an interest in the protests, and while the Burmese government initially grudgingly allowed the monks to participate in peaceful gatherings, the violence soon escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on the spot, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27, 2007, just for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll is listed at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army days before the official report, is quoted as saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you have heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities occurring in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive authority over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of such actions include incidents like the June 4, 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead, to reports from the Chinese Red Cross declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" a period spanning several years and countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz largely comes from his long career and his creative ability to mold his orchestra. While his presence on the piano is often subtle in many of the compositions chosen for this task, Ellington excelled as a composer in creating rich and complex pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. He designed a framework allowing soloists to freely improvise and wrote tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that utilized the unique styles of band members to emphasize musical ideas. In doing so, he also generally accentuated the orchestra's tone, crafting coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington's mastery of the sound of individual players and their fit within an evolving ensemble allowed him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, in discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites Creole Love Call as an example of using the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This is an early example of Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color without the constraint of lyrics. Creole Love Call also showcases Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece includes six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice starting smooth and melodic, then shifting to a rougher sound towards the end.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborating on the basic melody and emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice employing the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nTag: A brief tag with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a tonal dimension to this piece is an example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Even though in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" the same can be said today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study explores how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, together with experimental studies, can be used to illuminate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to outline quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that is a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils of a spiraled shell are called whorls, which are seen as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through space and time as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is on track to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those for water and sanitation, progress in child and maternal health is unfortunately far from the improvements needed to meet the target goals by 2015. The various reasons for these shortcomings are discussed below, indicating a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by a skilled health worker, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and much work remains. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also concerning, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than expected, around 4%. The cesarean rates also point to another concerning issue. While the cesarean rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas. This highlights the problem of equity in coverage across the country. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated around urban areas. Another access issue concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly, the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen discussing the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of services. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre- and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? There is no doubt that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. \"Vertical approaches,\" which target one sector of improvements, not only have much more targeted, manageable objectives but also generally produce faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for a particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock to the area with more resources (the effect of international funding on HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). Additionally, operating multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the past century to include such an array of genres that listing them all definitively is challenging. To add complexity, nearly all genres—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, to name a few—have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music in the last 40 years. It's expressive as it showcases a wide range of emotions, often leaning towards the darker end of the spectrum. It's diverse because soon after the genre began, people noticed its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, continuing this chain to the present day.\n\nToday, in the heavy metal movement, there are so many niche groups that it’s difficult to define what heavy metal exactly is. It has grown to incorporate numerous themes from other genres, yet, like everything, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand today’s metal music, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it’s more than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It can be seen as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. Less primitiveness, more skill; metal musicians are adept with their instruments, and this is evident in their music. Metal is also a movement heavily influenced by drugs, with the psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s leading people to create wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as an excuse for their creativity. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, a novelty in the music scene compared to popular music that lacked such dark emotional elements. Later metal generations have also drawn influence from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles reflect the darkness central to the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal The Beatles' darker side. They show the ups and downs, supposedly influenced by drugs. Some consider this song one of the first heavy metal tracks. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that also had a heavier, darker tone. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, thus including it on The White Album.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was meticulously shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a land she visits in a dream but also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself facing a challenging internal dilemma to realize this aspiration. The Dream is Rousseau's work that best encapsulates his lifelong inner struggle: whether to adopt or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to grant himself the freedom to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Henri Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Rousseau received no formal artistic training; instead, he worked until the age of forty for France as a gabelou, an employee of the municipal toll service, despite being mistakenly nicknamed douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). Consequently, he sought solace in a new life and turned to painting to find comfort and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of an average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, not only was he untrained in formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was also creating works alongside many other talented and more well-known modern artists. Although he had been working for many years, Rousseau only started to gain proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that while technically competitors in the art scene, the two differed not only in style and subject but also in their reasons for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a trite way, whereas Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats states in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is learned through education or experience. However, as Keats implies, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nCriticism of art or morals can never fully capture what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately these do not explain why it is good art. Instead, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that neither art nor morals can be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that it is this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is truly unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful force, a nation united by its unique cultural blend that stretches from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture can be experienced from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's center, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given such a distinct culture, it is not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, originates from many different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The name's origins are highly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. He borrowed this word from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They engage in almost daily battles with the Germans.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the meaning comes from the spear they used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” which described the origins of the Germans, noted that “I should regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and occasionally lead a land campaign, but in the end, they mostly returned home to their expansive empire. As the Germanic tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods taken from the land and offering their skills by serving in the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" conveys that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, in the end, a person must discard the false identity or risk losing themselves. A challenge in ending deception is the potential for feeling alienated. Thus, one must decide between self-preservation or preserving relationships with others. Some might respond neutrally to being deceived, but others might find it offensive.\n\nDeception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions such as why someone feels the need to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. In Viola's case, her actions are a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nUpon arriving in a foreign land, Viola pretends to be a man for safety. Her plan succeeds but isolates her from women, depriving her of support. Complicating matters, she is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also faces repressed romantic feelings with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo modern readers, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception reveals hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest they might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario's presence forces them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he seems male, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely not the case, as Olivia seems to parody those who judge others based on looks.\n\nThis is evidenced by Olivia's easy transition of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, viewing Cesario/Viola as family, not a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule was described by many observers as brutal, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course, such a vast colonial empire cannot be adequately captured by a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in its policies and ruling styles as it was in geography. Educational provisions across the colonies were similarly diverse. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a significant role in educating the native population, in South West Africa, education for natives was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government invested significant resources in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors led to the different experiences of South West Africa. This paper aims to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors explaining the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive aspects of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 resided in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that were once entangled in a lasting rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Many other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant conflicts of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to many other nations that have a lasting rivalry with a neighbor. Nations sharing a border are prone to conflicts of interest that lead to the development of rival positions between them. The rivalry between the United States and Mexico is akin to many other enduring rivalries between nations with a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been its rivals, while other nations in Latin America have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues created a division between the two nations, a problem that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, it was part ideological struggle and part competition over interests deemed vital by each nation. In this case, however, the ideological struggles were not based on political structures but rather on the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish. Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in establishing amicable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of the disputes described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to diminish as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended when American ambitions “shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico” (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nAt that time, I was a nurse. I chose this profession from a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" This was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - ideally a bit of both - I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old, single, with no significant money in the bank, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an attack on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there's one thing I know to be true. I could not have managed all these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all our faith in big government's \"basket\"; it's moldy and falling apart anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again - learning to help each other and ask for help - rather than each of us individually going out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times was not rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches, and canned goods, too. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food - do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Somewhere in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would one day be known as Buddha. Over his lifetime, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the emergence of Buddhism, the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is about two and a half millennia old; it appears different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This is evident everywhere, for example in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity. These differences extend from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada community, from both the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to both external and internal forces, both hostile and benign.\n\nThere are several qualifying terms that this discussion will frequently use. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force arising from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—a force arising from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not intend to harm or help the Buddhist community—although it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will appear repeatedly in this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is important to examine the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of all things. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are established. For laypeople, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation. It can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a specific entity. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding the generalizations of a culture is appropriate, it is far more productive for a negotiator to grasp the significance of a culture to the matter at hand and how that culture’s attitude can affect negotiations. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in a manner relatable to one's own culture, and comparisons naturally arise.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must accept it as it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the context of negotiation, and particularly if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, respecting traditions and beliefs when a negotiator is on \"foreign\" territory can only help to overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily confine itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a certain nation establish their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize long office hours or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others restrict it to “company-approved” charities or fundraisers. Observing differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, including urban to suburban environments) demonstrates the diversity of thought that can exist within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior simply indicates a need to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand because they provide the rationale behind a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is valued within a culture, a negotiator will certainly not publicly shame his company or superior to succeed at the negotiation table. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that places greater importance on hard-driven bargaining will not necessarily be inclined to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into account is crucial before one reaches the negotiating table. However, it is beneficial for a negotiator to learn something personal about his opponent to make the negotiation effective.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This belief seems to be shared by another author we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. Assuming a God-type figure different from the one in which our two authors believe would not allow us to adequately compare their arguments, as they essentially defend a specific concept of God. That said, I would suggest that while both present valid points, neither truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God. To illustrate this, we will first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith by looking within oneself for proof of God. He explains that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of his nonexistence. While this concept, when explained in his terms, is somewhat tedious and at times unclear, the main idea is that the proof of God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm suggests that we don't need to go beyond the confines of our soul to find the truth about God, but that the existence of this being is considered true simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting something without an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to in Christian texts as faith. This idea is quite different from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas proposes that the existence of God can be entirely proven through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. Such an idea would be advantageous in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Instead, they could be convinced by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you're told that you are missing a puzzle piece and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know the features and existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\"",
            "Many authors employ different methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects to their readers. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses a variety of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective with a noun that usually don't fit together to create a certain aura around a subject for the readers. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald builds meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a certain feeling around an important object for readers.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald develops and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being somewhat nicer and higher class, and gray being older and more faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the beginning of the novel through the constant use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\"—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gets his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by coloring many common, unimportant subjects with them: as Nick goes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—uniformity. He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough meaning, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something to readers first starts with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to see Daisy less as a character, more like a uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs more of this technique around Daisy to give the impression of her being a more uniform addition, for instance, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is highly productive agriculturally, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant market for food from organic, community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while improving habitats, permitting recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and other income-generating or educational activities.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in local plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming entails higher costs than conventional farming in some respects. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of large-scale operations. Practices not associated with organic farming but beneficial to wildlife can also lead to higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open patches. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel next to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It comprises 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still under review but currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for countless centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production over many intervening decades.\n\nI selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore what options a small farmer might realistically have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable connection. Within this bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand each other far more than anyone else with such a bond, and they can only see themselves when they look at their brother. It is in the most critical situations that the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they come with a high cost. Part of understanding the emotions born from this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the resulting consequences is where their true character lies. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers explore this theme and all the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which strongly influence his actions.  \nThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the moment he and his little brother, Doodle, first set out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment toward Doodle. He wanted a brother to whom he could teach all his worldly skills, like “...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “...someone to race to Horsehead Landing... and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...” Obviously, these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making it unlikely that he would even survive. Even then, it was almost impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, whose head was filled with wild fantasies, to see all those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to harbor some anger toward the small child, as he recalls contemplating killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction was probably not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative system for processing information. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a papyrus sheet, then a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you study the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The brain’s algorithms repeatedly transform sensory information in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object’s borders—where the color changes significantly over a short distance—to determine that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made during some steps of bottom-up processing to speed up the recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and to which cognitive processes it should be made available. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to the appearance of the printed word, phonemically, referring to how the word sounds, or semantically, referring to the meaning of the word. Once stored, the information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was engulfed in a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most vital companies were left in ruins. This recession persists today, prompting the question: how did this crisis arise, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing subprime loans into an already immature and inadequate financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the entire economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces its roots back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term in office. He aimed to extend his presidency by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately foresaw the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors combined to send the economy into a nosedive, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets, in general, becoming over-leveraged in the housing market, leaving them highly vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at exceptionally low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, captivating everyone with your magnetic, even magical prose. Or the part where your readers doze off and/or hit the \"Back\" button while muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin is known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself overwhelmed by excessive details, and not even in an entertaining way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are already familiar with the basic writing principle, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy text passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much happens. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder suggesting that you clear the history to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder encouraging the author to disclose every tiny detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character delivers a dump of information to another, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a particular place and time, they married in grand fashion, and her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span two pages, during which both characters only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior how deeply he loves his wife, and similarly, you would anticipate the heroine to reveal in various ways how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later directly states this). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, thereby becoming more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect depth on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and proceeds*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush through certain aspects. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was once in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was \"live,\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mugshot, and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this developing story. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think the time they spent on this story was appropriate.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was critically injured; there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been because he was a \"black\" man or it was a black neighborhood. I have noticed (for years) that minorities are often overlooked when they are victims of a crime. If, for example, a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but if it’s a minority, it’s lucky if it’s even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story concerned the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They described him as about six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing that he was black and how dark-skinned he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I am not sure what the angle was, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic; I don’t believe that was really relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction. Although these benefits are highly attractive, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would with a stock order. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. Even though these benefits are clearly stated, it's always a good practice for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, indeed exist and to what extent. For this purpose, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 holdings that make up the ETF to determine if the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also to see if there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, including every holding would be quite unwieldy, so we have decided to include only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart above, it's evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It's also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed so far, it seems that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo assess whether these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was somewhat disheartening, and it's difficult to pinpoint the cause. With winter setting in at a New England campus, there's a noticeable drop in people commuting by bike or on foot, which may partly explain the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so on. Completing the commuter log might have simply fallen off the radar for many people. Additionally, December brings the start of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus at all. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which could also be a clue to the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully explain the low submissions for February. One might speculate that any project of this type experiences an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm that naturally wanes. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to revive the initiative, which did result in increased log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum in light of both a natural decrease in engagement and specifically the issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative commuting modes. We offered many prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. However, it would have been interesting to see how some even larger prizes might have affected participation—such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could also have helped to address the dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn't really change during the project. If the prizes had increased in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed more than adequate at the project's start, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only imagine that participation and engagement would have increased rather than decreased.",
            "I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901 in the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique evolutionary features found in a few of the later films. Primarily, the trick films at the turn of the century are bound to a set, composed in front of a frontal proscenium, show no camera movement, use long and medium shots, and adhere to the strict method of one shot equaling one film. However, some films from the early twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by the trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films and has roots in theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally move only side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they go out of frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that the shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-ups are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is borrowed from the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the edges of the stage. As in most early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, note that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually consist of several joined together to create the illusion of appearing or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in both substance and name. The Gothic style has been criticized, praised, accused of lacking real depth, and celebrated for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to invoke (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the original \"Gothic Novel,\" used ideas from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws on medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of its publication, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which offers the reader a personal view of the characters' psychology, allows Gothic to persist and be both obsolete and new to readers far removed from the original writing.\n\nA prominent gothic theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly important to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived lack of such ideals in society, as seen by writers like Walpole. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (hinting at Gothic's evolution to Romantic) to try to improve the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was in politically troubled times and despaired over the future. Engaged in politics and facing (arguably) unfair accusations, he might have thought that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" from the gothic era had been lost in the 'present' society. This concept is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Described as a prince who has suffered, affected by tragedy, and thought to have been killed by infidels, Frederic's portrayal includes many traditional chivalric images. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the flow of processes that move goods from the customer's order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling activities within the supply chain to efficiently fulfill customer needs. The supply chain is made up of six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers use to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production, which is the foundation of the entire process. It involves determining when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to understand customer desires, which can be gauged by analyzing the market, the primary indicator of customer demands. After understanding these demands, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They determine the best location for production based on volume and quality while ensuring customer satisfaction. Once the site is chosen, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail in production is critical, as any oversight can cost the company time and money. For instance, in my experience with Wal-Mart and Target, both companies have structured processes for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes allow the company to operate smoothly without confusion.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and the development of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have various production divisions for one product, each with different equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the division that best suits the product's processes. They might also outsource work to create speed, which is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their rich detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that are considered Victorian but diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both employ elements of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which is atypical for novels of that period, thereby strengthening the characters in each work, offering insights that elaborate on their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, as their very words echoed in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, he realized he was speaking to them... Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts rose into the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and tumult, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and function vary in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event as if in a dream while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the dire condition of his health, which was strongly present through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, as he cannot bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even when his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this section, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I did my utmost to assist them in any subject where they were struggling, though my strengths were in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a little boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade), who was having significant difficulties with reading. It struck me that something was amiss; he had the most peculiar issues. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others he couldn't at all, it was the strangest thing. You see, he was of Latino descent, that much I was certain, yet the boy spoke perfect English. We continued to struggle until the day I met his mother. I was helping to watch over a few stragglers (for lack of a better word) while the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my very poor Spanish (I was just learning), we managed to communicate. But then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read well, he just wasn't very familiar with the English alphabet. I don’t know if that realization helped him much in the end, but I do hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. I also share it to show that it's not always as obvious as one might think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still pose a major obstacle. I believe everyone can agree this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was fairly straightforward: tutoring in English reading, especially focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There isn't a single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key lies in combining all of these approaches!\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea. Not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There is a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources, and that the majority of children in schools will not benefit. But that's incorrect. If we applied these programs as the norm in classrooms, rather than the exception, all children would benefit. How do we achieve this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No. That would be unreasonable and somewhat unrealistic. However, I do think there’s no reason we can't have special aides, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there larger than we are, greater than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to the temple or search within themselves for answers. Many of us readily accept the religions handed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them completely, denying that there can be anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one set of values only to later change our minds and embrace another. Whatever path we choose, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality. We search for a light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof above us as we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters directed the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the kind of gaze that seemed half searching, half remembering. Over the past few months, he had grown thinner, and his clothes hung limply from his body. His hair had thinned, more sparse than I remembered. He continued to stare into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because discussing it would make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December of that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father's suffering but merely kept him alive a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; what value there was in him suffering longer, I could not define. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him transition from this life into another. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of Republicanism. Though primarily a farmer, his career, along with a brief stint in politics, made him known for his dedication and candidness on issues of personal freedom and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system was foundational to almost all his governmental views. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the superior profession colored his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to create an ideal system, free from native tradition that could hinder government creators, thus enabling self-government. He was firm in his belief in the natural rights of man, viewing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. These rights should thus be out of governmental reach. He argued that the \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and malevolent intelligence but insisted this should not be true in a civilized society.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for man's inherent good and evil. He was very firm in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (ibid., p. 167). Good principles, as he defined them, protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on such principles would function fairly, despite being inevitably led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest was, in his view, man's motivation in all things, considered evil only when it led beyond a society based on public good into sub-societies living at others' expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, requiring careful oversight to prevent adding bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely despotic. However, he also considered a simple, literal interpretation risky, as it could become corrupt without reference to the framers' intent. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, explicitly describing the country as a group of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I stared downward, my mind blankly processing the view before me. Without emotion, in silence, with a practiced awareness that observed but refused to connect the subject of study to any abstract understanding, my mind analyzed the scene before my eyes. Thoughts flowed into my mind and vanished again almost as quickly as they appeared. My consciousness worked so smoothly and cleanly that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I observed. \n\nOnce, on the advice of an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the brain processes involved in interpreting lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wants to study. This transforms an overwhelmingly detailed image, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into an easily comprehensible image, that bowl of fruit on a simple plane. \n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally project that artist's frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in amazement. Picasso went through his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of presenting my perspective as artistically valuable, then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown. \n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool of artistry, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will taking shape, which could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter separated from the whole and were carried away into nothingness. Muscles tightened, jerked and spasmed a bit more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand struck the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nMop loosely held in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly as I looked at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter that someone had left as a message for the fools who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying behind the wheel. Several factors combine to create this deadly statistical vector for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem is that the teenage brain is literally not ready for the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience is also at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and running off the road. Teens also fare much worse when traveling with peers, which anyone with common sense knows they regularly do. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur. California and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring provisional licenses that limit the hours teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers. But provisional driver's licenses are, in my opinion, merely stopgap measures. The real issue is that the youngest drivers, as a group, are simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities by all statistical measures. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has conducted research suggesting that those under 19-20 often have a desire to take risks just for the thrill of it. It makes sense then to delay driving at least until the tendency to seek thrills decreases. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, not only will we continue to see deadly accidents, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road. Legislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education courses to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, and a certain number of practical driving hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number already required by most states (in California, for example, this number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. The legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",
            "This article addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a brief definition of the disorder. Then, the diagnosis is explained, along with common traits or \"red flags.\" Finally, the article concludes with ways a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity supporting that processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This means it is a disorder where the central nervous system (i.e., the brain) cannot correctly process what is heard. People with CAPD can hear normally and are thus not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain area responsible for translating what we hear, separating words, or distinguishing conversations from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder, which became known as CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced \"dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: the affected person may not be able to localize or hear sounds in space; may struggle to discriminate between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not recognize sound patterns; may not differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm from a change in voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may lack the ability to synthesize sound cues (that is, interpret them in a meaningful way to act upon); and may not determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the patient must undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently used with a high diagnostic success rate, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "While pursuing an education in social work, I aim to follow a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected and to support troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical character, a commitment to improving relationships among others, and enhancing my professional skills to remain competent in my field. These core values are important not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others but was unsure of the career path I wanted to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I saw many people deny their problems, and some used less than ideal coping mechanisms. Because of situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain about a career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents’ home. To see if I could help, I drove to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and mentioned that I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents since the law could do nothing for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior in involving outside help for “simple” disputes. After this experience, I seriously began considering a career in social work to help children with “simple” family disputes.\n\nAnother important value for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important, and we mourn those we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy limiting myself to be similar to others. Throughout my high school and college years, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothes that matched my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional set, declaring my involvement with the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "The text examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic information and health-related medical aspects. Sociocultural models focus on environmental relationships and their impact on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and explains selected research to illustrate and clarify them. The research explanations and findings are critiqued for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary, related to another mental disorder, or linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to another mental disorder connect to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia entails trouble staying awake, lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias involve behavioral and/or physiological abnormalities. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disability). This review mainly focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice found phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for sleep/wake states. GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, whereas inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that mouse models can apply to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for human GABAB receptors. Issues or absence of this receptor could affect sleep quality without medication. If the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and receptor changes could naturally disrupt sleep, impacting school, career, and everyday tasks requiring focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be an issue. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is practically the furthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in far-off places like the Willard Building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. In a conversation with an alum close to my age, I learned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large areas of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, large new buildings, including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the mobility problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to meet the needs of cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently resumed cycling after several years. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus; just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have classes in the Thomas Building, which is easily a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest path to the Thomas Building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's over two and a half hours each week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, etc. That's more time than I can spare.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of technology and the capitalist structure, which is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in his novel \"Brave New World.\" The people value the community over the individual and are conditioned from the start to prioritize immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. When examining the work through the lens of Marxist theism, one can see the author's underlying suspicions regarding the development of these systems. Common Marxist terminology, such as homogeneity and reification, reinforces the idea that Huxley's novel comments on the flaws in the emerging economy of his time. Capitalism is satirized through the Marxist thesis of false consciousness. Essentially, the common people are prevented from knowing their true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are mainly interested in their own gain. This is said to be the result of the ideological control of the proletariat and ordinary workers, something quite evident through the conditioning of the people in \"Brave New World.\" The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopaedia, the drive to consume, spend, and indulge is heightened above all else. This is manipulated, as previously mentioned, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by a separate group of individuals in totality, is clearly used in this case. The lower classes are completely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing; few Alphas or Betas, apart from characters like Bernard, do more than simply accept their place. In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between different individuals do not exist in \"Brave New World.\" The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters – they are, even among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprives man of free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, distinctly portrayed through the men's remarks about women, primarily about their physical appearance (i.e., pneumatic quality), and the women's unabashed comments about their encounters, so to speak. Furthermore, each societal class's complacency with their status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their absolute obedience in their role in the community is a reflection of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority over all else as long as they continue to consume, obey, and stay in line with the rest of their peers.",
            "Almost four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. One of the primary topics of intense discussion in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is more relevant today than ever. Looking back at the events since 9/11, I've personally seen the mass media transition from a hostile perspective on Islam and extremists to a strong tolerance for Islam in America. I don't believe in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has evident Muslim roots in his family. The Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, it contradicts his personality. From what I previously learned, I thought Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt Islam. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is depicted as a martyr, misunderstood, who even humbled himself before others. Subsequently, people came one by one to recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out. There are also striking similarities between the works of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most evident is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it to be more than enough for forty men. This writing style suggests to me that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet who needed to prove nothing but lived in truth and miracles. This kind of fallacy is troubling because it undermines the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it feels like they are trying to steal and claim credit for Jesus' life and essence through Muhammad. There are also numerous stories in the biography aiming to provide evidence of 'witness' or self-initiated conversions to Islam. But the issue is that many stories are from a third-party perspective. The author notes hearing from someone who heard from another, etc. I didn't appreciate this because, although intended to validate the stories, I felt it diminished them and made them more suspicious. What bothers me most about this work is their attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the notion of Muhammad being gentle and humble, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today understand the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought that advanced after his life. If we look at this history broadly, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further from its origins. Today's world seems to show an increasing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and resist any kind of thinking beyond what they were taught, this portion of the population may not be influential enough to affect the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. A desire will spread to differentiate the doctrines added over time to Christianity from the actual intent of the religion's namesake. It might take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a major reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow numerically, removing layers of doctrine as if the clock were turning backward, until nothing remains except a concept of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if living in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will turn into increasing uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. One example is how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that \"The Jungle\" reveals how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered. They focus primarily on improving their own lives and ignore those below them. This is depicted in many ways throughout the book. The most obvious example is the behavior of the owners and managers of large factories. Their main goal is to make their businesses as large and profitable as possible, with no regard for anyone or anything that stands in their way or is harmed by their progress. Upton Sinclair describes it as: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the great harm caused by this pollution, emphasizing that the owners have no regard for anyone or anything that might be hurt. They don't care about the massive smoke plumes from the factories or the animal waste runoff from the numerous pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also disregarded their employees, who worked to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"So from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They forced their employees to work long, grueling hours and could lay off many people without warning, without any compensation or help finding new jobs. During the era \"The Jungle\" is set in, there were few, if any, laws or regulations to protect workers' safety or well-being. This allowed managers and owners to act freely, pushing their employees to speed up production and work in terrible conditions. Although the book doesn't say it directly, those who lived and worked to exhaustion in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions both at work and in their living environments. There were no agencies or organizations to provide information or assistance to workers. While unions existed, they often did more harm than good, profiting from the poor workers. The workers were treated so badly and trapped in the Packingtown system that they were described as slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil used the term, but there is a more recent source that deserves some credit. Poe was very interested in German authors. This quote is important because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe’s writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems, concluding that Poe imitated Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature states that Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death, 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him the gift of a goblet. After her death, he begins to drink heavily and cry from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and leaves his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, perhaps a dark counterpart to Poe’s loss and reliance on drinking. Faust was also turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once, Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, but he uses this phrase in \"Dream-Land\" twice, as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark and lonely, haunted by dead friends, and sees a shadowy world without color. All of these scenes could be read into Goethe’s \"The King of Thule\" as he has just lost his wife, is lonely, and has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. Goethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work through the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages by showing that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager had been informed twice of the spill and neglected to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from the conduct, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning up a spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping in the months before Palmer’s incident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, but still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or in the absence of intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and carried out with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt like she needed something. There was this desire that refused to be satisfied. It began when she was about 14, just entering her teenage years. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By then, she had realized she wanted someone rather than something. Yet, she felt no interest in any boys. Some had been drawn to her, going through awkward attempts to win over the unapproachable, but none appealed to her. She often questioned herself about this strange feeling, trying to understand what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of contemplation led to theories, but nothing substantial enough for her to ponder deeply. So she lived her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other, and strangely enough, arguments with their daughter were rare. The only disputes they had were about her asserting her independence and free spirit. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she certainly countered their energies with her vibrant and fun personality, which made her very likable, along with the fact that she was a kind person.\n\nToday, however, was not a calm day. As she moved from room to room, looking for new inspiration for herself, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She rushed into the room, beginning to panic as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the floor, appearing to be in pain as she kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to offer help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured with her hands, and at that moment, the household hero was very grateful she had taken strength classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her down in the back, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the smell of disinfectant and illness, mixed with fear. But she didn't notice it, as her mind was too focused on helping her mother. She quickly carried the injured woman inside and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed and laid her mother on it. They took her for immediate examination, and her daughter was left to sit and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, emphasizing higher intake of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, with reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies documented an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet for promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Earlier studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake in the prior year. More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onward, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During 20 years of follow-up, 2,391 incident cases of CHD, 1,763 incident cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard above her head, with the unsettling message scrawled onto her sign with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, several street protests occurred, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began to take an interest in the protests, and while the Burmese government initially grudgingly allowed the monks to participate in peaceful gatherings, the violence soon escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on the spot, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27, 2007, just for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll is listed at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army days before the official report, is quoted as saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you have heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities occurring in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive authority over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of such actions include incidents like the June 4, 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead, to reports from the Chinese Red Cross declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" a period spanning several years and countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz largely comes from his long career and his creative ability to mold his orchestra. While his presence on the piano is often subtle in many of the compositions chosen for this task, Ellington excelled as a composer in creating rich and complex pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. He designed a framework allowing soloists to freely improvise and wrote tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that utilized the unique styles of band members to emphasize musical ideas. In doing so, he also generally accentuated the orchestra's tone, crafting coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington's mastery of the sound of individual players and their fit within an evolving ensemble allowed him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, in discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites Creole Love Call as an example of using the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This is an early example of Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color without the constraint of lyrics. Creole Love Call also showcases Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece includes six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice starting smooth and melodic, then shifting to a rougher sound towards the end.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborating on the basic melody and emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice employing the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nTag: A brief tag with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a tonal dimension to this piece is an example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Even though in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" the same can be said today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study explores how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, together with experimental studies, can be used to illuminate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to outline quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that is a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils of a spiraled shell are called whorls, which are seen as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through space and time as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is on track to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those for water and sanitation, progress in child and maternal health is unfortunately far from the improvements needed to meet the target goals by 2015. The various reasons for these shortcomings are discussed below, indicating a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by a skilled health worker, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and much work remains. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also concerning, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than expected, around 4%. The cesarean rates also point to another concerning issue. While the cesarean rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas. This highlights the problem of equity in coverage across the country. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated around urban areas. Another access issue concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly, the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen discussing the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of services. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre- and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? There is no doubt that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. \"Vertical approaches,\" which target one sector of improvements, not only have much more targeted, manageable objectives but also generally produce faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for a particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock to the area with more resources (the effect of international funding on HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). Additionally, operating multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the past century to include such an array of genres that listing them all definitively is challenging. To add complexity, nearly all genres—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, to name a few—have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music in the last 40 years. It's expressive as it showcases a wide range of emotions, often leaning towards the darker end of the spectrum. It's diverse because soon after the genre began, people noticed its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, continuing this chain to the present day.\n\nToday, in the heavy metal movement, there are so many niche groups that it’s difficult to define what heavy metal exactly is. It has grown to incorporate numerous themes from other genres, yet, like everything, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand today’s metal music, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it’s more than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It can be seen as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. Less primitiveness, more skill; metal musicians are adept with their instruments, and this is evident in their music. Metal is also a movement heavily influenced by drugs, with the psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s leading people to create wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as an excuse for their creativity. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, a novelty in the music scene compared to popular music that lacked such dark emotional elements. Later metal generations have also drawn influence from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles reflect the darkness central to the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal The Beatles' darker side. They show the ups and downs, supposedly influenced by drugs. Some consider this song one of the first heavy metal tracks. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that also had a heavier, darker tone. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, thus including it on The White Album.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was meticulously shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a land she visits in a dream but also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself facing a challenging internal dilemma to realize this aspiration. The Dream is Rousseau's work that best encapsulates his lifelong inner struggle: whether to adopt or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to grant himself the freedom to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Henri Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Rousseau received no formal artistic training; instead, he worked until the age of forty for France as a gabelou, an employee of the municipal toll service, despite being mistakenly nicknamed douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). Consequently, he sought solace in a new life and turned to painting to find comfort and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of an average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, not only was he untrained in formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was also creating works alongside many other talented and more well-known modern artists. Although he had been working for many years, Rousseau only started to gain proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that while technically competitors in the art scene, the two differed not only in style and subject but also in their reasons for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a trite way, whereas Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats states in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is learned through education or experience. However, as Keats implies, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nCriticism of art or morals can never fully capture what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately these do not explain why it is good art. Instead, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that neither art nor morals can be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that it is this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is truly unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful force, a nation united by its unique cultural blend that stretches from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture can be experienced from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's center, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given such a distinct culture, it is not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, originates from many different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The name's origins are highly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. He borrowed this word from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They engage in almost daily battles with the Germans.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the meaning comes from the spear they used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” which described the origins of the Germans, noted that “I should regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and occasionally lead a land campaign, but in the end, they mostly returned home to their expansive empire. As the Germanic tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods taken from the land and offering their skills by serving in the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" conveys that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, in the end, a person must discard the false identity or risk losing themselves. A challenge in ending deception is the potential for feeling alienated. Thus, one must decide between self-preservation or preserving relationships with others. Some might respond neutrally to being deceived, but others might find it offensive.\n\nDeception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions such as why someone feels the need to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. In Viola's case, her actions are a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nUpon arriving in a foreign land, Viola pretends to be a man for safety. Her plan succeeds but isolates her from women, depriving her of support. Complicating matters, she is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also faces repressed romantic feelings with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo modern readers, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception reveals hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest they might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario's presence forces them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he seems male, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely not the case, as Olivia seems to parody those who judge others based on looks.\n\nThis is evidenced by Olivia's easy transition of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, viewing Cesario/Viola as family, not a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule was described by many observers as brutal, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course, such a vast colonial empire cannot be adequately captured by a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in its policies and ruling styles as it was in geography. Educational provisions across the colonies were similarly diverse. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a significant role in educating the native population, in South West Africa, education for natives was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government invested significant resources in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors led to the different experiences of South West Africa. This paper aims to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors explaining the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive aspects of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 resided in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that were once entangled in a lasting rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Many other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant conflicts of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to many other nations that have a lasting rivalry with a neighbor. Nations sharing a border are prone to conflicts of interest that lead to the development of rival positions between them. The rivalry between the United States and Mexico is akin to many other enduring rivalries between nations with a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been its rivals, while other nations in Latin America have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues created a division between the two nations, a problem that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, it was part ideological struggle and part competition over interests deemed vital by each nation. In this case, however, the ideological struggles were not based on political structures but rather on the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish. Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in establishing amicable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of the disputes described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to diminish as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended when American ambitions “shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico” (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nAt that time, I was a nurse. I chose this profession from a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" This was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - ideally a bit of both - I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old, single, with no significant money in the bank, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an attack on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there's one thing I know to be true. I could not have managed all these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all our faith in big government's \"basket\"; it's moldy and falling apart anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again - learning to help each other and ask for help - rather than each of us individually going out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times was not rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches, and canned goods, too. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food - do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Somewhere in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would one day be known as Buddha. Over his lifetime, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the emergence of Buddhism, the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is about two and a half millennia old; it appears different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This is evident everywhere, for example in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity. These differences extend from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada community, from both the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to both external and internal forces, both hostile and benign.\n\nThere are several qualifying terms that this discussion will frequently use. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force arising from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—a force arising from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not intend to harm or help the Buddhist community—although it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will appear repeatedly in this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is important to examine the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of all things. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are established. For laypeople, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation. It can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is neither homogeneous nor a specific entity. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding the generalizations of a culture is appropriate, it is far more productive for a negotiator to grasp the significance of a culture to the matter at hand and how that culture’s attitude can affect negotiations. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in a manner relatable to one's own culture, and comparisons naturally arise.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must accept it as it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the context of negotiation, and particularly if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, respecting traditions and beliefs when a negotiator is on \"foreign\" territory can only help to overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily confine itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a certain nation establish their own corporate culture. For example, a corporate culture might emphasize long office hours or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others restrict it to “company-approved” charities or fundraisers. Observing differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, including urban to suburban environments) demonstrates the diversity of thought that can exist within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior simply indicates a need to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand because they provide the rationale behind a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is valued within a culture, a negotiator will certainly not publicly shame his company or superior to succeed at the negotiation table. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that places greater importance on hard-driven bargaining will not necessarily be inclined to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into account is crucial before one reaches the negotiating table. However, it is beneficial for a negotiator to learn something personal about his opponent to make the negotiation effective.",
            "\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This belief seems to be shared by another author we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. Assuming a God-type figure different from the one in which our two authors believe would not allow us to adequately compare their arguments, as they essentially defend a specific concept of God. That said, I would suggest that while both present valid points, neither truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God. To illustrate this, we will first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith by looking within oneself for proof of God. He explains that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of his nonexistence. While this concept, when explained in his terms, is somewhat tedious and at times unclear, the main idea is that the proof of God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm suggests that we don't need to go beyond the confines of our soul to find the truth about God, but that the existence of this being is considered true simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting something without an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to in Christian texts as faith. This idea is quite different from that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas proposes that the existence of God can be entirely proven through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. Such an idea would be advantageous in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Instead, they could be convinced by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you're told that you are missing a puzzle piece and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know the features and existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\"",
            "Many authors employ different methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects to their readers. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses a variety of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective with a noun that usually don't fit together to create a certain aura around a subject for the readers. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald builds meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a certain feeling around an important object for readers.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald develops and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being somewhat nicer and higher class, and gray being older and more faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the beginning of the novel through the constant use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\"—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gets his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by coloring many common, unimportant subjects with them: as Nick goes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—uniformity. He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough meaning, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something to readers first starts with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to see Daisy less as a character, more like a uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs more of this technique around Daisy to give the impression of her being a more uniform addition, for instance, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is highly productive agriculturally, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant market for food from organic, community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while improving habitats, permitting recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and other income-generating or educational activities.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in local plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming entails higher costs than conventional farming in some respects. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of large-scale operations. Practices not associated with organic farming but beneficial to wildlife can also lead to higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open patches. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel next to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It comprises 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still under review but currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for countless centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production over many intervening decades.\n\nI selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore what options a small farmer might realistically have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable connection. Within this bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand each other far more than anyone else with such a bond, and they can only see themselves when they look at their brother. It is in the most critical situations that the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they come with a high cost. Part of understanding the emotions born from this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the resulting consequences is where their true character lies. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers explore this theme and all the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which strongly influence his actions.  \nThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the moment he and his little brother, Doodle, first set out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment toward Doodle. He wanted a brother to whom he could teach all his worldly skills, like “...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “...someone to race to Horsehead Landing... and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...” Obviously, these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making it unlikely that he would even survive. Even then, it was almost impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, whose head was filled with wild fantasies, to see all those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to harbor some anger toward the small child, as he recalls contemplating killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction was probably not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative system for processing information. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a papyrus sheet, then a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you study the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The brain’s algorithms repeatedly transform sensory information in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object’s borders—where the color changes significantly over a short distance—to determine that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made during some steps of bottom-up processing to speed up the recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and to which cognitive processes it should be made available. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to the appearance of the printed word, phonemically, referring to how the word sounds, or semantically, referring to the meaning of the word. Once stored, the information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was engulfed in a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most vital companies were left in ruins. This recession persists today, prompting the question: how did this crisis arise, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing subprime loans into an already immature and inadequate financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the entire economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces its roots back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term in office. He aimed to extend his presidency by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately foresaw the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors combined to send the economy into a nosedive, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets, in general, becoming over-leveraged in the housing market, leaving them highly vulnerable to even small price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at exceptionally low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, captivating everyone with your magnetic, even magical prose. Or the part where your readers doze off and/or hit the \"Back\" button while muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin is known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself overwhelmed by excessive details, and not even in an entertaining way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are already familiar with the basic writing principle, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy text passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much happens. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder suggesting that you clear the history to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder encouraging the author to disclose every tiny detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character delivers a dump of information to another, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a particular place and time, they married in grand fashion, and her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span two pages, during which both characters only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior how deeply he loves his wife, and similarly, you would anticipate the heroine to reveal in various ways how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later directly states this). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, thereby becoming more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect depth on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and proceeds*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush through certain aspects. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was once in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was \"live,\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mugshot, and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this developing story. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think the time they spent on this story was appropriate.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was critically injured; there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been because he was a \"black\" man or it was a black neighborhood. I have noticed (for years) that minorities are often overlooked when they are victims of a crime. If, for example, a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but if it’s a minority, it’s lucky if it’s even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story concerned the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They described him as about six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing that he was black and how dark-skinned he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I am not sure what the angle was, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic; I don’t believe that was really relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction. Although these benefits are highly attractive, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would with a stock order. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available. Even though these benefits are clearly stated, it's always a good practice for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, indeed exist and to what extent. For this purpose, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 holdings that make up the ETF to determine if the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also to see if there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, including every holding would be quite unwieldy, so we have decided to include only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart above, it's evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It's also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed so far, it seems that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo assess whether these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was somewhat disheartening, and it's difficult to pinpoint the cause. With winter setting in at a New England campus, there's a noticeable drop in people commuting by bike or on foot, which may partly explain the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so on. Completing the commuter log might have simply fallen off the radar for many people. Additionally, December brings the start of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus at all. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which could also be a clue to the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully explain the low submissions for February. One might speculate that any project of this type experiences an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm that naturally wanes. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to revive the initiative, which did result in increased log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum in light of both a natural decrease in engagement and specifically the issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative commuting modes. We offered many prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. However, it would have been interesting to see how some even larger prizes might have affected participation—such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could also have helped to address the dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn't really change during the project. If the prizes had increased in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed more than adequate at the project's start, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only imagine that participation and engagement would have increased rather than decreased.",
            "I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901 in the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique evolutionary features found in a few of the later films. Primarily, the trick films at the turn of the century are bound to a set, composed in front of a frontal proscenium, show no camera movement, use long and medium shots, and adhere to the strict method of one shot equaling one film. However, some films from the early twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by the trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films and has roots in theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally move only side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they go out of frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that the shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-ups are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is borrowed from the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the edges of the stage. As in most early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, note that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually consist of several joined together to create the illusion of appearing or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in both substance and name. The Gothic style has been criticized, praised, accused of lacking real depth, and celebrated for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to invoke (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the original \"Gothic Novel,\" used ideas from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws on medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of its publication, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which offers the reader a personal view of the characters' psychology, allows Gothic to persist and be both obsolete and new to readers far removed from the original writing.\n\nA prominent gothic theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly important to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived lack of such ideals in society, as seen by writers like Walpole. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (hinting at Gothic's evolution to Romantic) to try to improve the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was in politically troubled times and despaired over the future. Engaged in politics and facing (arguably) unfair accusations, he might have thought that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" from the gothic era had been lost in the 'present' society. This concept is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Described as a prince who has suffered, affected by tragedy, and thought to have been killed by infidels, Frederic's portrayal includes many traditional chivalric images. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the flow of processes that move goods from the customer's order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling activities within the supply chain to efficiently fulfill customer needs. The supply chain is made up of six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers use to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production, which is the foundation of the entire process. It involves determining when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to understand customer desires, which can be gauged by analyzing the market, the primary indicator of customer demands. After understanding these demands, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They determine the best location for production based on volume and quality while ensuring customer satisfaction. Once the site is chosen, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail in production is critical, as any oversight can cost the company time and money. For instance, in my experience with Wal-Mart and Target, both companies have structured processes for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes allow the company to operate smoothly without confusion.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and the development of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have various production divisions for one product, each with different equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the division that best suits the product's processes. They might also outsource work to create speed, which is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their rich detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that are considered Victorian but diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both employ elements of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which is atypical for novels of that period, thereby strengthening the characters in each work, offering insights that elaborate on their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, as their very words echoed in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, he realized he was speaking to them... Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts rose into the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and tumult, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and function vary in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event as if in a dream while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the dire condition of his health, which was strongly present through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, as he cannot bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even when his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this section, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I did my utmost to assist them in any subject where they were struggling, though my strengths were in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a little boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade), who was having significant difficulties with reading. It struck me that something was amiss; he had the most peculiar issues. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others he couldn't at all, it was the strangest thing. You see, he was of Latino descent, that much I was certain, yet the boy spoke perfect English. We continued to struggle until the day I met his mother. I was helping to watch over a few stragglers (for lack of a better word) while the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my very poor Spanish (I was just learning), we managed to communicate. But then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read well, he just wasn't very familiar with the English alphabet. I don’t know if that realization helped him much in the end, but I do hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. I also share it to show that it's not always as obvious as one might think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still pose a major obstacle. I believe everyone can agree this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was fairly straightforward: tutoring in English reading, especially focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There isn't a single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key lies in combining all of these approaches!\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea. Not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There is a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources, and that the majority of children in schools will not benefit. But that's incorrect. If we applied these programs as the norm in classrooms, rather than the exception, all children would benefit. How do we achieve this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No. That would be unreasonable and somewhat unrealistic. However, I do think there’s no reason we can't have special aides, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual.",
            "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there larger than we are, greater than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to the temple or search within themselves for answers. Many of us readily accept the religions handed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them completely, denying that there can be anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one set of values only to later change our minds and embrace another. Whatever path we choose, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality. We search for a light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof above us as we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters directed the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the kind of gaze that seemed half searching, half remembering. Over the past few months, he had grown thinner, and his clothes hung limply from his body. His hair had thinned, more sparse than I remembered. He continued to stare into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because discussing it would make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December of that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father's suffering but merely kept him alive a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; what value there was in him suffering longer, I could not define. What kind of God would do this, I thought. Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI had not wanted to watch him transition from this life into another. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family, and knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of Republicanism. Though primarily a farmer, his career, along with a brief stint in politics, made him known for his dedication and candidness on issues of personal freedom and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system was foundational to almost all his governmental views. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the superior profession colored his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to create an ideal system, free from native tradition that could hinder government creators, thus enabling self-government. He was firm in his belief in the natural rights of man, viewing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. These rights should thus be out of governmental reach. He argued that the \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and malevolent intelligence but insisted this should not be true in a civilized society.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for man's inherent good and evil. He was very firm in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (ibid., p. 167). Good principles, as he defined them, protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on such principles would function fairly, despite being inevitably led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest was, in his view, man's motivation in all things, considered evil only when it led beyond a society based on public good into sub-societies living at others' expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, requiring careful oversight to prevent adding bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely despotic. However, he also considered a simple, literal interpretation risky, as it could become corrupt without reference to the framers' intent. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, explicitly describing the country as a group of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I stared downward, my mind blankly processing the view before me. Without emotion, in silence, with a practiced awareness that observed but refused to connect the subject of study to any abstract understanding, my mind analyzed the scene before my eyes. Thoughts flowed into my mind and vanished again almost as quickly as they appeared. My consciousness worked so smoothly and cleanly that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I observed. \n\nOnce, on the advice of an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the brain processes involved in interpreting lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wants to study. This transforms an overwhelmingly detailed image, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into an easily comprehensible image, that bowl of fruit on a simple plane. \n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally project that artist's frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in amazement. Picasso went through his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of presenting my perspective as artistically valuable, then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown. \n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool of artistry, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, my mind's will taking shape, which could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter separated from the whole and were carried away into nothingness. Muscles tightened, jerked and spasmed a bit more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand struck the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nMop loosely held in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly as I looked at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter that someone had left as a message for the fools who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying behind the wheel. Several factors combine to create this deadly statistical vector for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that one aspect of the problem is that the teenage brain is literally not ready for the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience is also at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only leads to more fatal accidents but also to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and running off the road. Teens also fare much worse when traveling with peers, which anyone with common sense knows they regularly do. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur. California and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring provisional licenses that limit the hours teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers. But provisional driver's licenses are, in my opinion, merely stopgap measures. The real issue is that the youngest drivers, as a group, are simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities by all statistical measures. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has conducted research suggesting that those under 19-20 often have a desire to take risks just for the thrill of it. It makes sense then to delay driving at least until the tendency to seek thrills decreases. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, not only will we continue to see deadly accidents, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be ready to hit the road. Legislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education courses to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, and a certain number of practical driving hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number already required by most states (in California, for example, this number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. The legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",
            "This article addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a brief definition of the disorder. Then, the diagnosis is explained, along with common traits or \"red flags.\" Finally, the article concludes with ways a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity supporting that processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This means it is a disorder where the central nervous system (i.e., the brain) cannot correctly process what is heard. People with CAPD can hear normally and are thus not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain area responsible for translating what we hear, separating words, or distinguishing conversations from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder, which became known as CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced \"dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: the affected person may not be able to localize or hear sounds in space; may struggle to discriminate between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not recognize sound patterns; may not differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm from a change in voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may lack the ability to synthesize sound cues (that is, interpret them in a meaningful way to act upon); and may not determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the patient must undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently used with a high diagnostic success rate, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "While pursuing an education in social work, I aim to follow a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected and to support troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical character, a commitment to improving relationships among others, and enhancing my professional skills to remain competent in my field. These core values are important not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others but was unsure of the career path I wanted to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I saw many people deny their problems, and some used less than ideal coping mechanisms. Because of situations I witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain about a career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents’ home. To see if I could help, I drove to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and mentioned that I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents since the law could do nothing for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior in involving outside help for “simple” disputes. After this experience, I seriously began considering a career in social work to help children with “simple” family disputes.\n\nAnother important value for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important, and we mourn those we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy limiting myself to be similar to others. Throughout my high school and college years, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothes that matched my personality, piercing my ears beyond the traditional set, declaring my involvement with the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "The text examines the biological and sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic information and health-related medical aspects. Sociocultural models focus on environmental relationships and their impact on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and explains selected research to illustrate and clarify them. The research explanations and findings are critiqued for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary, related to another mental disorder, or linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to another mental disorder connect to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia entails trouble staying awake, lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias involve behavioral and/or physiological abnormalities. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disability). This review mainly focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice found phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for sleep/wake states. GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, whereas inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that mouse models can apply to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for human GABAB receptors. Issues or absence of this receptor could affect sleep quality without medication. If the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and receptor changes could naturally disrupt sleep, impacting school, career, and everyday tasks requiring focus.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be an issue. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is practically the furthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in far-off places like the Willard Building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. In a conversation with an alum close to my age, I learned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large areas of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, large new buildings, including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the mobility problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to meet the needs of cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently resumed cycling after several years. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus; just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have classes in the Thomas Building, which is easily a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest path to the Thomas Building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's over two and a half hours each week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, etc. That's more time than I can spare.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of technology and the capitalist structure, which is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in his novel \"Brave New World.\" The people value the community over the individual and are conditioned from the start to prioritize immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. When examining the work through the lens of Marxist theism, one can see the author's underlying suspicions regarding the development of these systems. Common Marxist terminology, such as homogeneity and reification, reinforces the idea that Huxley's novel comments on the flaws in the emerging economy of his time. Capitalism is satirized through the Marxist thesis of false consciousness. Essentially, the common people are prevented from knowing their true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are mainly interested in their own gain. This is said to be the result of the ideological control of the proletariat and ordinary workers, something quite evident through the conditioning of the people in \"Brave New World.\" The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopaedia, the drive to consume, spend, and indulge is heightened above all else. This is manipulated, as previously mentioned, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by a separate group of individuals in totality, is clearly used in this case. The lower classes are completely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing; few Alphas or Betas, apart from characters like Bernard, do more than simply accept their place. In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between different individuals do not exist in \"Brave New World.\" The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters – they are, even among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprives man of free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, distinctly portrayed through the men's remarks about women, primarily about their physical appearance (i.e., pneumatic quality), and the women's unabashed comments about their encounters, so to speak. Furthermore, each societal class's complacency with their status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their absolute obedience in their role in the community is a reflection of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority over all else as long as they continue to consume, obey, and stay in line with the rest of their peers.",
            "Almost four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. One of the primary topics of intense discussion in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is more relevant today than ever. Looking back at the events since 9/11, I've personally seen the mass media transition from a hostile perspective on Islam and extremists to a strong tolerance for Islam in America. I don't believe in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, who has evident Muslim roots in his family. The Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, it contradicts his personality. From what I previously learned, I thought Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt Islam. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is depicted as a martyr, misunderstood, who even humbled himself before others. Subsequently, people came one by one to recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out. There are also striking similarities between the works of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most evident is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it to be more than enough for forty men. This writing style suggests to me that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet who needed to prove nothing but lived in truth and miracles. This kind of fallacy is troubling because it undermines the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it feels like they are trying to steal and claim credit for Jesus' life and essence through Muhammad. There are also numerous stories in the biography aiming to provide evidence of 'witness' or self-initiated conversions to Islam. But the issue is that many stories are from a third-party perspective. The author notes hearing from someone who heard from another, etc. I didn't appreciate this because, although intended to validate the stories, I felt it diminished them and made them more suspicious. What bothers me most about this work is their attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the notion of Muhammad being gentle and humble, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today understand the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought that advanced after his life. If we look at this history broadly, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further from its origins. Today's world seems to show an increasing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and resist any kind of thinking beyond what they were taught, this portion of the population may not be influential enough to affect the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. A desire will spread to differentiate the doctrines added over time to Christianity from the actual intent of the religion's namesake. It might take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a major reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow numerically, removing layers of doctrine as if the clock were turning backward, until nothing remains except a concept of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if living in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will turn into increasing uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. One example is how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that \"The Jungle\" reveals how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered. They focus primarily on improving their own lives and ignore those below them. This is depicted in many ways throughout the book. The most obvious example is the behavior of the owners and managers of large factories. Their main goal is to make their businesses as large and profitable as possible, with no regard for anyone or anything that stands in their way or is harmed by their progress. Upton Sinclair describes it as: \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the great harm caused by this pollution, emphasizing that the owners have no regard for anyone or anything that might be hurt. They don't care about the massive smoke plumes from the factories or the animal waste runoff from the numerous pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also disregarded their employees, who worked to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"So from top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They forced their employees to work long, grueling hours and could lay off many people without warning, without any compensation or help finding new jobs. During the era \"The Jungle\" is set in, there were few, if any, laws or regulations to protect workers' safety or well-being. This allowed managers and owners to act freely, pushing their employees to speed up production and work in terrible conditions. Although the book doesn't say it directly, those who lived and worked to exhaustion in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions both at work and in their living environments. There were no agencies or organizations to provide information or assistance to workers. While unions existed, they often did more harm than good, profiting from the poor workers. The workers were treated so badly and trapped in the Packingtown system that they were described as slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil used the term, but there is a more recent source that deserves some credit. Poe was very interested in German authors. This quote is important because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe’s writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems, concluding that Poe imitated Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature states that Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death, 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" The poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him the gift of a goblet. After her death, he begins to drink heavily and cry from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and leaves his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, perhaps a dark counterpart to Poe’s loss and reliance on drinking. Faust was also turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once, Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, but he uses this phrase in \"Dream-Land\" twice, as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark and lonely, haunted by dead friends, and sees a shadowy world without color. All of these scenes could be read into Goethe’s \"The King of Thule\" as he has just lost his wife, is lonely, and has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. Goethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work through the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages by showing that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager had been informed twice of the spill and neglected to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from the conduct, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning up a spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping in the months before Palmer’s incident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, but still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or in the absence of intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and carried out with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt like she needed something. There was this desire that refused to be satisfied. It began when she was about 14, just entering her teenage years. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By then, she had realized she wanted someone rather than something. Yet, she felt no interest in any boys. Some had been drawn to her, going through awkward attempts to win over the unapproachable, but none appealed to her. She often questioned herself about this strange feeling, trying to understand what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of contemplation led to theories, but nothing substantial enough for her to ponder deeply. So she lived her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other, and strangely enough, arguments with their daughter were rare. The only disputes they had were about her asserting her independence and free spirit. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she certainly countered their energies with her vibrant and fun personality, which made her very likable, along with the fact that she was a kind person.\n\nToday, however, was not a calm day. As she moved from room to room, looking for new inspiration for herself, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She rushed into the room, beginning to panic as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the floor, appearing to be in pain as she kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to offer help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured with her hands, and at that moment, the household hero was very grateful she had taken strength classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her down in the back, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the smell of disinfectant and illness, mixed with fear. But she didn't notice it, as her mind was too focused on helping her mother. She quickly carried the injured woman inside and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed and laid her mother on it. They took her for immediate examination, and her daughter was left to sit and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, emphasizing higher intake of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, with reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious prospective studies documented an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet for promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Earlier studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake in the prior year. More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onward, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could affect results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During 20 years of follow-up, 2,391 incident cases of CHD, 1,763 incident cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",

In 2007, several street protests occurred, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began to take an interest in the protests, and while the Burmese government initially grudgingly allowed the monks to participate in peaceful gatherings, the violence soon escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on the spot, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27, 2007, just for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll is listed at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army days before the official report, is quoted as saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you have heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities occurring in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive authority over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of such actions include incidents like the June 4, 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead, to reports from the Chinese Red Cross declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" a period spanning several years and countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz largely comes from his long career and his creative ability to mold his orchestra. While his presence on the piano is often subtle in many of the compositions chosen for this task, Ellington excelled as a composer in creating rich and complex pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. He designed a framework allowing soloists to freely improvise and wrote tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that utilized the unique styles of band members to emphasize musical ideas. In doing so, he also generally accentuated the orchestra's tone, crafting coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington's mastery of the sound of individual players and their fit within an evolving ensemble allowed him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, in discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites Creole Love Call as an example of using the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This is an early example of Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color without the constraint of lyrics. Creole Love Call also showcases Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece includes six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice starting smooth and melodic, then shifting to a rougher sound towards the end.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborating on the basic melody and emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice employing the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nTag: A brief tag with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a tonal dimension to this piece is an example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Even though in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical language,\" the same can be said today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study explores how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, together with experimental studies, can be used to illuminate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to outline quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that is a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils of a spiraled shell are called whorls, which are seen as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through space and time as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade. While the country is on track to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those for water and sanitation, progress in child and maternal health is unfortunately far from the improvements needed to meet the target goals by 2015. The various reasons for these shortcomings are discussed below, indicating a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by a skilled health worker, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and much work remains. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also concerning, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than expected, around 4%. The cesarean rates also point to another concerning issue. While the cesarean rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas. This highlights the problem of equity in coverage across the country. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated around urban areas. Another access issue concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly, the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen discussing the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of services. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre- and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? There is no doubt that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. \"Vertical approaches,\" which target one sector of improvements, not only have much more targeted, manageable objectives but also generally produce faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to consider. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for a particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock to the area with more resources (the effect of international funding on HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). Additionally, operating multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the past century to include such an array of genres that listing them all definitively is challenging. To add complexity, nearly all genres—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, to name a few—have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music in the last 40 years. It's expressive as it showcases a wide range of emotions, often leaning towards the darker end of the spectrum. It's diverse because soon after the genre began, people noticed its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, continuing this chain to the present day.\n\nToday, in the heavy metal movement, there are so many niche groups that it’s difficult to define what heavy metal exactly is. It has grown to incorporate numerous themes from other genres, yet, like everything, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand today’s metal music, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it’s more than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It can be seen as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. Less primitiveness, more skill; metal musicians are adept with their instruments, and this is evident in their music. Metal is also a movement heavily influenced by drugs, with the psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s leading people to create wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as an excuse for their creativity. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, a novelty in the music scene compared to popular music that lacked such dark emotional elements. Later metal generations have also drawn influence from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles reflect the darkness central to the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal The Beatles' darker side. They show the ups and downs, supposedly influenced by drugs. Some consider this song one of the first heavy metal tracks. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that also had a heavier, darker tone. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, thus including it on The White Album.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was meticulously shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a land she visits in a dream but also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself facing a challenging internal dilemma to realize this aspiration. The Dream is Rousseau's work that best encapsulates his lifelong inner struggle: whether to adopt or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to grant himself the freedom to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Henri Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Rousseau received no formal artistic training; instead, he worked until the age of forty for France as a gabelou, an employee of the municipal toll service, despite being mistakenly nicknamed douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). Consequently, he sought solace in a new life and turned to painting to find comfort and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of an average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, not only was he untrained in formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was also creating works alongside many other talented and more well-known modern artists. Although he had been working for many years, Rousseau only started to gain proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that while technically competitors in the art scene, the two differed not only in style and subject but also in their reasons for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a trite way, whereas Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats states in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is learned through education or experience. However, as Keats implies, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nCriticism of art or morals can never fully capture what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately these do not explain why it is good art. Instead, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that neither art nor morals can be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that it is this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is truly unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful force, a nation united by its unique cultural blend that stretches from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture can be experienced from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's center, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given such a distinct culture, it is not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, originates from many different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The name's origins are highly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. He borrowed this word from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They engage in almost daily battles with the Germans.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the meaning comes from the spear they used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” which described the origins of the Germans, noted that “I should regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and occasionally lead a land campaign, but in the end, they mostly returned home to their expansive empire. As the Germanic tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods taken from the land and offering their skills by serving in the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" conveys that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, in the end, a person must discard the false identity or risk losing themselves. A challenge in ending deception is the potential for feeling alienated. Thus, one must decide between self-preservation or preserving relationships with others. Some might respond neutrally to being deceived, but others might find it offensive.\n\nDeception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions such as why someone feels the need to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. In Viola's case, her actions are a form of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nUpon arriving in a foreign land, Viola pretends to be a man for safety. Her plan succeeds but isolates her from women, depriving her of support. Complicating matters, she is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Viola also faces repressed romantic feelings with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo modern readers, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception reveals hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest they might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario's presence forces them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he seems male, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely not the case, as Olivia seems to parody those who judge others based on looks.\n\nThis is evidenced by Olivia's easy transition of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, viewing Cesario/Viola as family, not a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule was described by many observers as brutal, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course, such a vast colonial empire cannot be adequately captured by a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in its policies and ruling styles as it was in geography. Educational provisions across the colonies were similarly diverse. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a significant role in educating the native population, in South West Africa, education for natives was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government invested significant resources in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors led to the different experiences of South West Africa. This paper aims to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors explaining the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive aspects of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 resided in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that were once entangled in a lasting rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Many other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant conflicts of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to many other nations that have a lasting rivalry with a neighbor. Nations sharing a border are prone to conflicts of interest that lead to the development of rival positions between them. The rivalry between the United States and Mexico is akin to many other enduring rivalries between nations with a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been its rivals, while other nations in Latin America have enjoyed and continue to enjoy good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious issues created a division between the two nations, a problem that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, it was part ideological struggle and part competition over interests deemed vital by each nation. In this case, however, the ideological struggles were not based on political structures but rather on the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish. Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in establishing amicable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of the disputes described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to diminish as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended when American ambitions “shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico” (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nAt that time, I was a nurse. I chose this profession from a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" This was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - ideally a bit of both - I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old, single, with no significant money in the bank, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an attack on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there's one thing I know to be true. I could not have managed all these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all our faith in big government's \"basket\"; it's moldy and falling apart anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again - learning to help each other and ask for help - rather than each of us individually going out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times was not rugged individualism, but compassion, mutual respect, and sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches, and canned goods, too. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food - do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Somewhere in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would one day be known as Buddha. Over his lifetime, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the emergence of Buddhism, the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is about two and a half millennia old; it appears different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This is evident everywhere, for example in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity. These differences extend from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada community, from both the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to both external and internal forces, both hostile and benign.\n\nThere are several qualifying terms that this discussion will frequently use. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force arising from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—a force arising from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not intend to harm or help the Buddhist community—although it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will appear repeatedly in this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is important to examine the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of all things. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are established. For laypeople, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome."
