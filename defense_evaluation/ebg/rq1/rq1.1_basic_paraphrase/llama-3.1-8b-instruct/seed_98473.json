            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The values that drive me to excel in this field are rooted in my personal conviction to provide service, respect, and uphold an ethical code of conduct. I am committed to enhancing my professional skills to ensure that I remain a valuable asset in my field, and work towards fostering stronger relationships within my community. These core values are not only essential for social workers but also deeply ingrained in my personal character.\n\nDuring my high school and college years, I was drawn to careers that would allow me to make a difference in the lives of others. However, it wasn't until I witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of denial and unhealthy coping mechanisms that I became determined to explore a career path in social work. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009. Despite initially feeling uncertain about my career path, a pivotal experience that summer changed my perspective. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was seeking refuge from his abusive home life. The next day, he contacted the authorities, and in an effort to offer support, I accompanied him to his parents' residence. I expressed my concerns to the police, who were then faced with limited options. I then spoke with the parents, who downplayed their son's abuse, attributing it to manipulation and trivial disputes. This harrowing experience sparked my resolve to pursue a career in social work, specifically to help families navigate conflicts and provide support to those in need.\n\nAnother fundamental aspect of social work that resonates with me is the pursuit of social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, yet our actions often contradict this ideal. We mourn the loss of unique individuals, yet we strive for conformity. I believe in embracing my individuality and rejecting the pressure to conform. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively challenged social injustices, expressing myself through my style, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights with GSBA, and combating racism and prejudice whenever possible. As a proponent of social justice, I will continue to advocate for those who are marginalized and oppressed.",
            "This paper examines the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors in the context of insomnia. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical aspects of sleep disorders, while the sociocultural model explores the environmental influences and their effects on different demographic groups, including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographics. This review aims to analyze existing research related to these models, explaining the findings and critiquing their strengths and limitations. \n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, or sleep disorders caused by medical issues or substance abuse. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass a range of sleep disorders, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining adequate or restful sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and automatic REM sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with abnormal behaviors and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions include those associated with Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation).\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genetic, heritable, and physiological factors that influence sleep. Recent research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin, which play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The use of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, suggesting that this mechanism can be generalized to humans. This finding implies that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the physical GABAB receptor in humans, which is essential for adequate sleep. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, even without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, this research suggests that the inherited phenotype of the receptor can regulate sleep, and any alterations could naturally disrupt sleep patterns, negatively impacting daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), an auditory condition that affects how the brain processes sound information. First, the disorder's definition is outlined. Then, the process of diagnosis is explained, highlighting common characteristics, or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper explores ways in which a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) refers to the brain's efficiency in processing auditory information. In essence, CAPD is a condition where the brain fails to properly interpret sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. This condition doesn't result from hearing impairment, but rather from the brain's inability to accurately process and separate sounds, such as distinguishing between words or conversation from background noise.\n\nResearch on CAPD dates back to the 1950s. The disorder was initially known as \"auditory imperception\" when researchers first identified it in children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing assessments in 1954. Later, in 1961, Kimura introduced a method of testing called dichotic testing and developed a model explaining the brain's physiology underlying this process. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty localizing sounds in space, differentiating between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, or detecting changes in speech. Additionally, an individual with CAPD may experience sounds being blocked by subsequent sounds or struggle to interpret sound clues. They may also have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information presented.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using systematic observation and various tests of auditory function. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists use a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills. These assessments may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors. However, there is no single, universally accepted tool for diagnosing CAPD, and the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple sounds simultaneously and asking them to differentiate between specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals and measuring the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "The theme of deception is a recurring motif in Twelfth Night, suggesting that while adopting a disguise can facilitate deception, it may ultimately lead to the loss of one's identity if not abandoned. However, the process of revealing a deception can also cause alienation, as individuals may struggle to reconcile their true selves with their relationships with others, who may respond with varying degrees of acceptance or offense. This dilemma is particularly complex when deception involves gender role reversal, raising questions about the motivations behind such actions. In the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is a desperate measure to protect herself from potential threats, as evidenced by her words, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). \n\nAs a result of her disguise, Viola finds herself disconnected from her female support network and confronted with unrequited romantic feelings towards both Olivia and Orsino. Her convincing performance as a man also raises questions about the true nature of Olivia's affections, with some interpretations suggesting that she may be exploring repressed desires. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario based on his masculine appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? While it is more likely that Olivia is satirizing the societal norms of her time, which judged people solely on their appearance, her rapid shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her eventual acceptance of Viola as family (as seen in \"A sister, you are she,\" 5.1.315) further complicates this issue. The play thus offers a nuanced exploration of the consequences of deception, particularly in the context of gender role reversal, and the complex emotions that can arise from it.",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa, is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the German colonial empire's policies and approach to governance varied significantly across its territories, both in terms of geography and in their educational provisions. When Britain took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Meanwhile, German educational efforts in other colonies, such as Kamerun, had been praised by contemporary authors. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, was vastly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in the education of the native population by establishing state schools, in South West Africa, the task of educating the locals was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. However, the government invested heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions. These policy decisions had lasting effects on the region, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies had a notable number of literate and educated Africans, the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. A complex array of social, economic, and political factors contributed to this divergence in educational experiences. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature examining education within the German colonial empire, with the majority of these sources written in German and published during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in the various colonies, while later studies in English expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education across different colonies and providing in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa provided a detailed comparison of the two colonies' educational systems and shed light on the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, albeit with a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. The European population in the region took advantage of these favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 settlers residing in South West Africa by 1913, far outpacing the 5,336 settlers in the next largest colony, East Africa.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded significantly, encompassing a multitude of genres that are challenging to list comprehensively. Furthermore, most genres, such as rock, country, and jazz, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making it increasingly difficult to define their boundaries. The evolution of Heavy Metal rock is a striking example of this trend, as it has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the last 40 years. Characterized by its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, primarily on the darker end of the emotional spectrum, Heavy Metal has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, allowing artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, which has resulted in an ever-growing number of niches within the movement.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is so diverse and multifaceted that it is challenging to pinpoint its core identity. The genre has borrowed elements from other styles, yet its origins are rooted in something distinct. To truly appreciate the diversity of Metal music that exists today, it is essential to understand the essence of the movement and the reasons behind its emergence.\n\nAt its core, Metal is often defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its emphasis on intensity, volume, and theatricality. Metal music often features complex instrumentation, showcasing the technical proficiency of its performers. Additionally, its history is closely tied to the 1970s psychedelic movement, during which artists used drugs as a creative catalyst, resulting in experimental and otherworldly works. This emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion was a departure from the more lighthearted and upbeat nature of mainstream music at the time. Later generations of Metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on intense emotional expression, which is evident in the lyrics of many Metal songs. For instance, the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, exemplifies the darker, more erratic tone that has come to characterize the genre. This song was, in part, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker work, with the Beatles seeking to demonstrate their own capacity for intensity and darkness.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists created their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was already bringing his own visions to life. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's wonder in a fantastical dream world but also reflects Rousseau's own personal aspirations and struggles as an artist. Rousseau's lifelong goal was to gain recognition and acceptance from his peers and art enthusiasts, but he faced a dilemma – should he conform to established styles to be accepted by the art world or stay true to his unique creative vision. This internal struggle is perfectly encapsulated in The Dream, a painting that represents Rousseau's career-long conflict between artistic conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, it's essential to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in northwest France, Rousseau came from a relatively affluent family. He received no formal art training and instead worked as a municipal toll collector for over 40 years. His personal life was marked by tragedy, including the loss of his first wife and many children, leaving him with only one daughter. He turned to painting as a means of coping with his grief and finding a new sense of purpose. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's work was rooted in his own humble background and experiences.\n\nGiven his unconventional path to art and the timing of his career, Rousseau's desire for recognition is understandable. He began painting later in life, around the same time as other prominent artists, including Henri Matisse. While Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid clichés in his work, Rousseau sought to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français. As author Jan Gordon notes, their styles and motivations were distinct, reflecting their individual artistic visions and goals.",
            "Many thinkers have pointed out a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats states in his poem, \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are intricately linked. Much of what we know in life comes from education and experience, but we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics in a more instinctual way, as if they are inherent and can't be taught. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe and understand, rather than prescribe rules or guidelines. Our studies of morality and beauty seek to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than providing a set of rules for creating or judging good art or behavior.\n\nIn fact, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the heart of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussing the value of a piece like the Mona Lisa might focus on specific elements like composition or cultural context, but these aspects don't fully capture why it's considered a masterpiece. When people describe a favorite work of art or literature, they often use phrases like \"There's just something about it\" before offering more detailed analysis. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As writers like Flannery O'Connor and Ludwig Wittgenstein suggest, there's something essential and transcendent that can't be fully expressed.\n\nI propose that this \"something\" – this intangible quality – is the key to the connection between ethics and aesthetics. This transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them. We experience both art and morality most profoundly at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as McKean points out that literature's unique moral quality sets it apart from other art forms. Literature has the power to convey values that are essential to human experience, making it a vital part of our lives.",
            "Today, Germany is a powerful and unified nation with its own distinct culture that spans from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from the Rhine River city of Cologne to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique cultural identity is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes that have shaped the country. \n\nThe origin of the term \"German\" is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and historians. According to Tacitus, the name might be derived from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with Gaulish forces. On the other hand, Julius Caesar is credited with using the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he distinguished between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had yet to encounter. Caesar likely borrowed the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to describe their neighboring tribes. In his writings, Caesar notes that the Germans were a constant thorn in the side of the Gauls, engaging in almost daily battles. Some etymologists propose that the name \"German\" could be related to a spear called a \"ger\" used in warfare, while others suggest it might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus recorded his observations about the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98. He described the Germans as an indigenous people who had not been significantly influenced by immigration or intermarriage with other cultures. Tacitus questioned why anyone would leave more hospitable regions like Asia, Africa, or Italy to settle in the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Germania. Similarly, it was unlikely that Romans would leave their sprawling empire to settle in Germania, instead choosing to send their soldiers and traders to the region to exploit its resources and skills. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their services as soldiers and traders.",
            "I stood there, my mind blank and disengaged from the scene in front of me.  I observed the scene without any emotional attachment, my thoughts floating in and out of my mind at an incredible speed.  It felt like my consciousness was functioning on autopilot, processing the visual information without any personal connection or interpretation. \n\nI had always been fascinated by art, and I had even tried to learn drawing techniques from a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  This book provided step-by-step instructions on understanding the basics of drawing, including the process of interpreting lines.  One specific technique it taught was to frame a picture with a square, simplifying complex scenes into more manageable shapes. \n\nAs I gazed at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't bring myself to mentally impose this technique.  I was too overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of what I saw, and I found myself standing there in awe.  Artists like Picasso and Monet had their distinct styles, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance featured a wide range of colors.  If I was to consider myself an artist, the scene before me had the potential to be the beginning of my masterpiece, Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up the toilet plunger, my hand tightening and relaxing as I prepared to tackle the task.  However, my hand smacked the handle again, and I struggled to dislodge the stubborn clog.  Eventually, I resorted to grabbing a mop, a green tie constricting my neck, and prepared to tackle the unpleasant task.  A few more flushes and some calming moments later, I donned the toilet paper roll as a makeshift glove and reached into the bowl, my hand dipping in like a parent preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "A disturbing trend is emerging: teenagers are dying in car accidents.  Several factors contribute to this alarming statistic among young American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health suggest that a key factor is that a teenager's brain may not be developmentally ready to handle the dangers of driving.  Another crucial factor is the inexperience of driving, which does not only lead to more fatal accidents but also increases the rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  Moreover, when teenagers drive with their peers, the risks escalate.  Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents. \n\nIn an effort to improve road safety, California and other states have introduced temporary provisional licenses for teenagers, restricting their driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers.  However, these measures are seen as temporary solutions.  The fundamental issue lies in the fact that as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically incapable of managing the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.  According to psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, even at 18, the brain is not mature enough to handle the demands of driving.  His research has also revealed that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risk-taking behavior for the thrill of it.  Given this, it makes sense to delay licensing until this behavior subsides.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents will likely continue to rise, potentially reaching catastrophic levels in the coming years.  By 2010, the number of new teen drivers will surge as the Baby-Boomer's children reach driving age. \n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a straightforward process.  Driver's education classes in schools can still be provided to initiate the learning process for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, and a set number of practical driving hours could be required.  This number could be based on the existing requirements in most states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California.  Given that the problem affects a cross-section of states, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country.  The proposed legislation is not a novel concept, but rather a much-needed solution to a pressing issue.",
            "Upon browsing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to analyze all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily utilized creative editing techniques to create illusions. My research mainly focused on identifying the poetic elements in most trick films and examining the distinctive features of a few later ones that broke away from the norm. During this period, trick films were generally shot on a set, confined within a frontal proscenium, used stationary cameras, and adhered to the principle of one shot per film. However, some early 20th-century films experimented with these guidelines by introducing multiple shots.\n\nOne notable trait common to many trick films is their setting within an interior space framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remained static, never moving to follow characters or objects. This composition was inspired by theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. The use of the stage had its limitations, as characters in trick films usually only moved side-to-side, without walking towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side and moved horizontally within the frame, while the camera remained fixed.\n\nThe conventional frontal proscenium composition led to the frequent use of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups were never employed in any of the Edison catalog's trick films, drawing inspiration from theater and vaudeville, where the audience witnessed the entire performance within the stage's borders. In early films, actors usually remained in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, resulting in no close-ups. Most early trick films adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot equating to a single film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricted the narrative or dramatic potential of trick films, which mainly focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts with little storytelling. However, it's worth noting that in trick films, a single conceptual shot could be composed of multiple physical shots to create the illusion of an apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a closer inspection reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an agriculturalist and politician who played a significant role in advocating for Republicanism. His career in both fields instilled in him a strong commitment to individual freedom and a limited government. His conviction in the importance of an agrarian system was the foundation of his views on governance, shaping his opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system. His goal was to preserve and promote the values he believed were essential to a superior way of life.\n\nTaylor was of the opinion that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by existing traditions. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of humanity, which he saw as interconnected and interdependent. As such, he believed these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference. In his view, the concept of the \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical strength and intelligence often exploited others, but he believed this shouldn't be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for the dual nature of human beings, encompassing both good and evil. He firmly held to a dualistic morality, arguing that government, being human, would reflect both virtues and vices. According to Taylor, good principles included protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function equitably, even under the influence of self-interest. However, he recognized that self-interest could be a positive force when it contributed to the public good, but it became detrimental when it led to the exploitation of others. A fair government was essential to balance human nature's inherent evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of corrupting influences.\n\nSimilar to many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He envisioned a Federal government with limited powers and no more rights than those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He was aware that a large Federal government was expensive and potentially despotic, but he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation could lead to corruption without considering the original intent of the Constitution's authors. Additionally, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence a more authentic charter for the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collective of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, a notable decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month of the project, and the reasons behind it are uncertain. Winter's arrival on a New England campus often leads to a decrease in bike and foot traffic, which could be linked to a portion of the drop. Additionally, with the end of the fall semester in December, participants might have overlooked completing the commuter log amidst their busy schedules of finishing schoolwork and grading. The holiday season's onset and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty may have also contributed to the low submissions, as many were not required to be on campus. The return to classes in late January coincided with another low submission period. While it's possible that a project's initial energy and enthusiasm naturally wane over time, the low February numbers were particularly puzzling. In an effort to revitalize the project, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which resulted in an increase in log submissions. This was a significant challenge, as the project faced not only a typical decrease in engagement but also the impact of holiday and semester breaks unique to the higher education setting.\n\nAnother challenge this project, or any commuting initiative, faces is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving. To address this, incentives for alternative modes of commuting must be provided. We offered gift cards to local businesses, but it would be interesting to see how larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, could have influenced participation, potentially offsetting the dip in engagement. Maintaining a consistent prize structure throughout the project didn't yield the desired results. However, increasing the value of prizes over time might have had a more substantial impact. If we had announced additional, high-value prizes in December and January, such as bicycles and hybrid or electric cars, participation and engagement might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but offers a higher degree of flexibility and is traded like a stock on an exchange.  ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, purchase on margin, and buy as few as one share per transaction.  Although these benefits are highly attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the need to pay a commission on any ETF trade, just like a stock order.  One of the benefits of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  When evaluating the benefits of ETF ownership, it's essential for savvy financial investors to assess whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent they do so. \n\nIn this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF provides benefits comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same 10 stocks, and whether alternative configurations of the same stocks could yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming complexity, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  Below, you'll find the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the representativeness of the top 10 stocks as a whole, we can use their current asset percentage to calculate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of Beta and return are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF overall.  Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with lower risk.  However, it's possible that the differences between these portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's notable poems is \"Dream-Land\", where he employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. The term is attributed to Virgil by Thomas Mabbott, who used it to describe an island north of Britain, believed to be the edge of the known world by the Greeks. However, it is likely that Poe drew inspiration from a more contemporary source, as he was well-versed in German literature. \n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is evident in his use of the term \"Thulé\", which is significant because it highlights his connections to Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", notes the similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe. \n\nGoethe was a renowned writer, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust\", published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. Within the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which tells the story of a king who, after the death of his wife, engages in excessive drinking and grief, ultimately deciding to end his life. The similarities between the King of Thulé and the character in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, possibly symbolizing Poe's own struggles with loss and reliance on drinking.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is further evident in the fact that \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Additionally, Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" but uses \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land\" as a bookend, suggesting a connection between the two poems. \n\nReading \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" together reveals a striking companionship between the two works, with both authors exploring themes of loss, loneliness, and a desolate world. The parallels between the two poems are even more pronounced, with both works depicting a world devoid of color and hope. It is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's work through his respect for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the numerous reproductions of Goethe's writings that were widely available after the original publication of \"Faust\".",
            "In California, a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice.  A judge is unlikely to dismiss a customer's claim for punitive damages without considering her case. To be eligible for punitive damages, the customer must show that the manager's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm they could cause, and that these actions were particularly reprehensible. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill because similar incidents had occurred at the store in the past. The manager's failure to clean the spill, despite knowing the potential harm it could cause, may be seen as despicable considering that several slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store over the course of a year. \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the store manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in the store. Martin replied that he was on a break and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Prior to her accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store in 2009. Palmer is suing the store for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the court is considering whether to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been nearly four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, where the topic of whether Islam is a hostile religion sparked intense debate.  This question remains highly relevant today, particularly when looking back at the media's portrayal of Islam before and after the events of 9/11. The shift from a predominantly negative view to an extreme level of tolerance for Islam in the United States is a striking transformation. It is unlikely that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who openly acknowledged his Muslim heritage, would have been considered viable in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography is quite fascinating to me, given the apparent disparity between his historical depiction and the personality traits attributed to him. Prior to reading his biography, I perceived Muhammad as a forceful figure who coerced people into converting to Islam through conquest and domination. However, the biography portrays him as a humble and misunderstood figure who was often humbled by others. According to the narrative, people gradually came to understand the truth of his teachings and sought him out as a result.\n\nThere are some intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. One notable example is when he allegedly multiplied food for forty men using mutton and milk. This storytelling style contributes to the image of Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but rather lived a life of truth and performed miracles. This narrative approach, in my opinion, downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, and may be seen as an attempt to borrow from Jesus' persona.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous accounts that aim to demonstrate how people converted to Islam of their own free will. However, many of these stories are secondhand, as they are passed down through multiple narrators. While the intention behind these stories may be to provide evidence of their truth, they ultimately diminish the accounts and raise suspicions about their credibility.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the portrayal of Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical records paint a different picture, contradicting the image presented in the biography. I find it difficult not to wonder whether Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As the years went by after Jesus' life, the ideas and teachings he promoted during his time were gradually lost in the development of Christian thought.  A broader look at history reveals a trend where Christianity has been diverging further and further from its roots.  Currently, there is a growing awareness and increasing tendency towards progress.  Although traditionalists will stick to their original teachings and resist any deviation, they might not have enough influence to impact the overall shift.  In the years to come, a heightened sense of historical awareness will emerge among Christians, and a desire will arise to distinguish between the true teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that have been incorporated into Christianity over time.  This process might take time, but it is inevitable:  a reversal in the trend of Christian history will occur, and the faith will gradually return to its original form.  There will be a movement that will remove layer upon layer of added doctrine, much like rewinding a clock, until only the core essence of Jesus' message remains.  When this trend spreads to the United States and Europe, it will influence the masses, causing them to adopt a more authentic, Jesus-centered way of worship, free from the influence of later thinkers.  The church institution will remain strong, guiding the way, but the extreme diversification of Christian traditions will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  As a result, regional, denominational, and interpersonal differences will diminish, replaced by a greater sense of unity.  History is replete with remarkable transformations, such as the Roman Empire's shift from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, and the progression of the United States from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  Similarly, the Christian faith is poised for a great reversal, one that will involve a return to its source and a reduction in the diversity that has developed over time.  A crucial aspect of this process will be the interpretation of Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  If we look back far enough, we can see that the Christian faith originated from Judaism, a monotheistic faith based on divinely revealed scripture and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, which existed long before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  However, the Jewish population was not unified; it consisted of various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "The Jungle by Upton Sinclair highlights the inherent self-centered nature of humanity, where individuals prioritize their own interests and well-being above all else, disregarding the welfare of those around them. This is evident in the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who are solely focused on expanding and profiting from their businesses, without regard for the consequences to the environment, workers, or their own lives. Sinclair vividly describes the devastating impact of industrial pollution, as seen in the \"great chimneys belching smoke into the sky,\" and the owners' disregard for the harm caused by animal waste and pollution. The book also reveals the exploitative treatment of employees, who are subjected to grueling working conditions and unpredictable layoffs without any support or compensation.\n\nThis lack of regulation during the time period allowed the factory owners and managers to operate freely, pressuring employees to work at an unsustainable pace and in hazardous conditions. The absence of protective laws and organizations left workers vulnerable and powerless, with limited access to resources or assistance. Even the formation of unions often backfired, benefiting the owners more than the workers. The situation is likened to a system of slavery, where workers are trapped and dependent on the whims of their oppressors, leading to inevitable and widespread immorality.",
            "Authors often employ various techniques to influence readers' emotions and perceptions of significant subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully utilizes multiple techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby to convey certain impressions. One of his methods involves associating an adjective with a noun in a non-conventional way to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Another technique, which Fitzgerald frequently uses, is assigning meaning to symbols, such as colors, and leveraging them to convey specific emotions. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up the meaning behind several colors, including white, gray, and the combination of red and pink. He establishes these color associations at the beginning of the novel and then utilizes them to evoke a specific feeling or reminder in relation to important objects.\n\nFor instance, Fitzgerald associates white and gray with uniformity. In the novel, white is often linked with a sense of refinement and higher social status, while gray represents a more aged and faded quality. Fitzgerald introduces these associations early on by repeatedly using both colors in various contexts. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white attire, such as in the description of Daisy being \"in white\" (8). Other characters like Nick wear white clothing to Gatsby's parties, and Tom is described wearing a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is describing his impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are described as being adorned with primary colors.\n\nFitzgerald further solidifies these color associations by applying them to everyday, unimportant subjects, such as places and people. For example, when Nick commutes to work, he goes down the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56). Fitzgerald also describes common people and places as being white or gray, like the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes. After establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to signify a lack of importance or uniformity. This technique is first employed when describing Daisy, who is initially characterized as being in a white dress in a \"little white roadster\" (74). Through repeated use of these colors, Fitzgerald reinforces the idea that Daisy is more of a uniform, desirable object for Gatsby rather than a fully fleshed-out character.\n\nFitzgerald continues to employ this technique to convey a sense of uniformity around Daisy, using colors to downplay her character. For instance, Daisy is described as having a \"gray haze of her fur collar\" (18) and is again wearing white (115) before Tom and Gatsby's encounter. By using colors in this way, Fitzgerald skillfully manipulates the reader's perception of Daisy and her significance in the novel.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural productivity can be attributed to its pleasant, sunny climate. A variety of crops thrive in this region, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture in San Diego is substantial, resulting in lengthy waiting lists for many local organizations. Organic products such as eggs and milk are also in high demand. Some organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations and allow visitors to engage in recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. \n\nThis type of operation can help a landowner take advantage of government programs while promoting environmental conservation, allowing for recreational use and educational opportunities. Organic farming often has several benefits, including increased biodiversity in the area due to reduced chemical use. However, it can be more labor-intensive and costly in certain aspects compared to conventional farming, including manual pest control, soil fertilization, and higher loss rates. Furthermore, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Additional practices beneficial to local wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, can also be more labor-intensive. As a result, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to optimize both their profits and habitat quality. \n\nThe chosen land is situated near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and spans 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered and declining species such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production over the years. To research possible cost-reducing strategies and wildlife-friendly practices, I selected a property from a real estate website and explored government programs available to small farmers. A nearby organic farm in the same area serves as a model for the types of operations this landowner might aim to establish.",
            "Cultural dynamics play a crucial role in any negotiation, making it essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding. Rather than reducing a culture to oversimplified stereotypes, it's more productive to grasp the significance it holds in the context of the negotiation and how its values will influence the interaction. When engaging with a foreign culture, individuals often relate to it through the lens of their own, resulting in inevitable comparisons.\n\nGaining insight into a culture can involve delving into its history, acknowledging its biases, and accepting its inherent complexities rather than trying to change or judge it. This acceptance is particularly vital during negotiations, especially when one party holds a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for the cultural norms and values of the other party can help bridge any cultural gaps and facilitate a more productive negotiation, even when in a foreign setting.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that cultural boundaries are not solely defined by national or international affiliations. Corporate cultures within a country can be significantly distinct, often shaped by their unique values, work environments, and practices. For instance, some companies prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed atmosphere. These variations can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The differences within American corporate culture, from company to company and even region to region, serve as a testament to the diversity that exists within a particular societal culture.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's core values is crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers. If a culture places a high value on avoiding shame or maintaining communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superiors to secure a successful outcome. Conversely, in a culture that prioritizes the pursuit of a strong bargain, the negotiator may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these generalities prior to the negotiation, one can better tailor their approach to achieve a more effective outcome. It's also beneficial for a negotiator to develop a personal understanding of their counterpart to enhance the negotiation's success.",
            "The phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the foundation of St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas also shares a similar viewpoint, albeit with a differing approach. Since both of their arguments are centered around the same concept, we will assume that both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible to facilitate a fair comparison. This assumption is necessary as their arguments would be rendered incomparable if they were advocating for a generic, non-specific deity. Although both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas present valid points, their arguments lack a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will analyze the central argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's reasoning follows a path of faith, focusing on introspection to find proof of God. He suggests that because God exists within our understanding, it is impossible to conceive of his nonexistence. Although the intricacies of his explanation can be complex and unclear, the core idea is that the evidence for God lies within one's own mind. Anselm proposes that we do not need to look beyond our own consciousness to find truth about God; instead, the existence of this being is self-evident and can be understood by examining the inherent truths we know within ourselves. This concept, which relies on accepting something without empirical proof, is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a different perspective, one that relies solely on reason and empirical evidence to prove the existence of God, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be beneficial for evangelism as it would enable the recruitment of new believers who are persuaded by logic rather than faith. Thomas Aquinas outlines five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through these arguments, he demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity of his existence. He uses the analogy of a completed puzzle to illustrate that one can infer the existence and characteristics of a missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince destined to be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly life, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings led to the establishment of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional sect. This ancient religion, now over 2,500 years old, has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhism is prominent, the annual water-cutting ceremony is a significant event that involves both monks and laypeople, despite the Buddha not teaching about any such celebrations. This divergence is evident in the way the religion has evolved, encompassing everything from surface-level customs to its core teachings. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay perspectives, has seen its principles change over time due to internal and external, hostile and benign forces.\n\nKey terms used throughout this discussion include internal and external forces, where internal forces refer to influences originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, and external forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are driven by a negative perception of Buddhism and aim to harm the community, while benign forces, although neutral in intent, may inadvertently cause harm or benefit. These definitions will be recurring throughout this discussion.\n\nTo understand the essence of Theravada Buddhism, it is crucial to examine its fundamental doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka, consisting of three baskets of texts: the Sutta Pitaka, which contains the discourses; the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which encompasses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include the notion of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes rules for laypeople and monks, with the former adhering to the five precepts (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and sobriety). For monks, there are additional disciplinary rules. The four noble truths are the fundamental principles of Buddhism: first, the truth of suffering; second, the understanding that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "For over five decades, the United States and Mexico experienced a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States invaded and defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. This conflict was a pivotal moment in the history of the two nations, marking a significant turning point in their relationship. However, clashes between the two countries continued to occur until just before World War I, fueled by their differences in culture, tradition, and material interests.\n\nThis scenario is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship, as many nations with shared borders often experience disputes over competing interests. The United States and Mexico are not an exception, as their geographic proximity and cultural differences created a fertile ground for rivalry. Historian David M. Pletcher notes that only Mexico and Cuba have presented long-standing diplomatic challenges to the United States, due to their close geographical proximity and historical conflicts.\n\nOne of the primary sources of tension between the two nations was their differing religious beliefs, which, as Sally Frahm points out, were a major obstacle to their relations in the past. The United States' opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, inherited from the English and Spanish colonial powers, created an ideological divide between the two countries. This ideological struggle was further complicated by the distrust inherited from their former colonial rulers, making it challenging for the two nations to establish friendly relations.\n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico was marked by numerous disputes, with 17 recorded incidents during the 57-year period, as documented by Diehl and Goerts. The majority of these disputes were related to territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. The use of military force by both countries to secure their borders eventually brought an end to these problems.\n\nAccording to Schmitt, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and the US's focus shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the latter part of the 19th century. This marked a significant shift in the nature of their relationship, paving the way for a more cooperative and less confrontational dynamic between the two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suffered a sudden and unexpected illness that left me disabled. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen this profession to find stability, driven by the promise that \"you'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" This mantra resonated with me from adolescence, as I prioritized job security over my true aspirations to be a scientist or journalist.\n\nHowever, life took an unexpected turn when I found myself at the age of 46, single, with little savings and unable to work. After fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I've lost everything that was truly mine. Each day is a struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-esteem, with uncertainty at every turn. Yet, one thing remains certain: I couldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends, who helped me navigate the darkest times.\n\nIn times of crisis, people often feel a false sense of strength that vanishes when disaster strikes. My experience serves as a reminder that life is unpredictable, and no matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should diversify our dependence on the government, I believe that rebuilding trust within our communities would be a more effective approach. Americans should focus on learning to rely on one another and ask for help when needed, rather than trying to go it alone. The idea of rugged individualism, touted by some, is often romanticized, but in reality, our ancestors relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to overcome hardships. Those pioneers who braved the journey across the Rockies in wagon trains found success through collective effort.\n\nWhile preparation is essential, don't underestimate the power of community. I'm prepared with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials, but I also recognize the importance of building relationships with my neighbors. By combining preparedness with a sense of community, we can create a more resilient society.",
            "The underlying reasons for the evolutionary paths of organisms are still not fully understood. Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that scientists were far from being able to define even the simplest organic forms using mathematical language, this remains a challenge to this day. However, recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk shell development, including both their growth and evolution (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research is focused on using mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, in conjunction with experimental studies, to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental changes. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We then created hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA mollusk shell can be thought of as a structure that forms a spiral path over time, spanning 360 degrees of space. The individual turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella. The rate at which whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, with the apex at the tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, with the typical orientation being an apertural view, where the aperture is facing the viewer and the apex is pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture begins. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl. \n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center coordinates and horizontal and vertical radii of each whorl's aperture, we can trace the path of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. With a mathematical formulation in place, we can then modify parameters to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite showing little improvement over the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia remain a pressing concern.  The country's progress in achieving certain Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, is not being matched by gains in child and maternal health, with significant gaps in progress towards the 2015 targets.  The reasons behind these shortcomings are multifaceted and suggest that Indonesia needs to bolster its overall healthcare system rather than solely focusing on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen some advancements in the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion.  However, this metric encompasses traditional practitioners like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complications, contributing to the higher rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the improvements in this area might be misleading, indicating that more work needs to be done.  Furthermore, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases by a healthcare professional has decreased, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, highlighting concerns about the country's healthcare services.\n\nCesarean-section rates in Indonesia remain lower than expected, particularly in rural areas where they stand at 2%, compared to 7% in urban settings.  This disparity underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with a focus on urban areas.  The contrast between the service utilization rates of the wealthiest and poorest quintiles - a 27% gap - also raises concerns about vertical equity, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the shortage of services.  Should Indonesia prioritize strengthening its overall healthcare system or adopt targeted programmatic approaches that focus on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While program-specific approaches may yield faster results and more manageable objectives, they also have drawbacks, such as diverting resources and personnel away from other areas of the health sector.  Moreover, the duplication of services and lack of coordination between programs can lead to administrative burdens and inefficiencies.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the lives of the aristocracy during this period.  However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this traditional mold by incorporating elements of mystery and the unusual. Through these unique narrative devices, the characters in both novels are more deeply developed, providing readers with a better understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\nOne notable example of this can be seen in the mind-bending passage from a scene in Oliver Twist, where the protagonist finds himself caught up in a chaotic and disorienting sequence of events. The scene describes how the main character's thoughts become increasingly jumbled, and he finds himself reliving the traumatic experience of a shooting, which is portrayed as a dream-like state. This sequence highlights Oliver's lack of control over the circumstances surrounding the shooting and the severe toll it has taken on his health. As his senses become numb, the pain and fear become a constant presence, leaving the reader questioning whose actions led to his misfortune. This scene suggests that Oliver has been worn down and is struggling to cope, implying that he has lost the will to fight for control over his life.\n\nSimilarly, a passage from another scene in Oliver Twist describes a day that seems to blend into night, characterized by an eerie silence and a sense of time passing rapidly. This atmosphere of despair is a common thread throughout the novel, as Oliver's experiences continue to weigh heavily on him.",
            "About two years ago, I worked at an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students in various subjects, but I specialized in English and reading. I was approached by an instructor to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading despite being in the third or fourth grade. I was puzzled by his difficulties, as he found some letters easy to pronounce while others were almost impossible for him. This caught my attention, and I soon discovered that Adrian's mother, who only spoke Spanish, was present during our sessions. We managed to communicate using a basic understanding of Spanish, but it was then that I realized Adrian's issue was not with reading, but with knowing the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenges posed by language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It is often not immediately apparent, even for students who speak fluent English, as in Adrian's case. This issue affects many students, and finding a solution is not straightforward. In Adrian's situation, addressing his problem was relatively simple – he needed extra help with English reading, particularly with the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and other methods on their own are insufficient to address the issue. Instead, a combination of these approaches is necessary. \n\nThe dual language system, which is often viewed as a resource-intensive idea, is actually beneficial for all students. Research has shown that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that this approach may not be effective for the majority of students, the reality is that it can benefit all students if implemented widely. However, implementing this system in classrooms requires careful consideration. It is not necessary for all teachers to be bilingual, as that would be unrealistic and impractical. Instead, schools can employ specialized aids, tutors, or support staff who are fluent in multiple languages to help students who need it.",
            "From an early age, many of us are led to believe that there is something greater than ourselves that we can't fully understand. Some people attend church, temple, or explore their own spirituality, while others accept the faith passed down by their parents or reject it entirely. Whatever path we choose, we are on a journey of self-discovery through our individual perspectives on spirituality, searching for guidance and meaning in life. \n\nThis introspection was reflected in a conversation I once had with my father, when I asked him about his favorite type of bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the sound of rain on the tin roof, as the rain poured down the gutters and washed away the plants along the edge of the porch. My father gazed out into the rain, lost in thought, his health visibly declining over the past few months. He seemed disconnected, and I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I was going to miss him, as acknowledging it would make the reality even harder to bear. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in looking out into the rain, trying to find a sense of comfort in the shared moment.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. Although the chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the doctors' predictions, they failed to ease his suffering. I couldn't help but question the value of prolonging his life, wondering what kind of higher power would allow this to happen. Alone at night, I didn't pray, as I had lost faith in a higher being that would listen. \n\nI had chosen not to witness his passing, unable to watch the person who created me leave this world. Instead, I chose to remember my father through the happy memories of his life, not the agony of his death. I also knew that he wouldn't have wanted me to be present during his final moments, so I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for news of his passing. Unfortunately, no one even reached out to me during that difficult time.",
            "Ian Watt describes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its contradictory nature. The Gothic mode has been both criticized for lacking depth and praised for its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime.' Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the original Gothic novel, drew upon the ideas of both ancient and modern romances to create a new genre and literary style. By combining old theatrical elements with modern narrative techniques, Walpole created a unique form of expression, which he referred to as \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic genre often incorporates elements of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the term \"Gothic\" being associated with different peoples, styles, and time periods during the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication. As a result, the term \"Gothic\" was often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements. However, the blending of the theatrical aspects of Gothic literature with the novel's format, which allows readers to delve into the characters' psychologies, has enabled the Gothic genre to endure and remain relevant despite being both old and new to readers.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry, which is derived from medieval ideals of knighthood. In The Castle of Otranto, this concept is both preserved and transformed. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, as it represented the ideal of the brave, honorable, and competent knight. By idealizing and romanticizing the chivalric past, Gothic writers aimed to critique the present and suggest improvements. Walpole, writing during a tumultuous period, was disillusioned with the potential future and possibly felt that the moral and innate goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This sentiment is reflected in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits and is described as a gallant and courteous prince who has suffered nobly.",
            "Supply chain management is a series of interconnected processes that oversee the movement of goods from raw materials to customers, encompassing stages such as production, supply, and distribution. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling the flow of goods to meet customer demands efficiently. Six key components underpin supply chain management: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial stage in the supply chain process, serving as its foundation. It involves defining the when, why, where, and how of production, based on market analysis and customer demand. To gain insights into customer needs, managers analyze market trends, which provide valuable indicators of demand. With a thorough understanding of customer requirements, managers determine the products to produce, their quantities, and the most suitable production locations, taking into account factors like volume and quality. Once production locations are identified, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Every detail in the production process is crucial, as any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses in the long run. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed detailed guides and processes to ensure smooth operations and minimize confusion among employees.\n\nThe second critical element in supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process, and may also opt to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to provide high-quality products while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "A chilling message reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" on a sign held by Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, as she stands alone on a street corner. The sign's contents are a reference to Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962. In 2007, mass street protests erupted, led by Burmese monks donning saffron-colored robes, sparking the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the public began to take notice of the protests, but the situation soon escalated into a violent conflict between the military junta and the monks, with foreign journalists, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, being violently suppressed. According to Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, the actual death toll from the protests is much higher than the reported 13 fatalities, with estimates suggesting thousands of victims.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. The desire to suppress dissent and maintain control has been a recurring theme throughout human history. From the Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule to Japanese emperors being believed to be divine leaders, there are numerous examples of governments attempting to exert total control over their citizens. Even in modern times, world leaders have been known to engage in similar tactics, such as having secret meetings with influential figures. History is replete with instances of brutal crackdowns on dissent, including the infamous 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where estimates of deaths range from several hundred to over 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and moderates, and the atrocities committed during Hitler's reign, which resulted in the systematic persecution and murder of Jews, are other stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz stems from his extended career and his ability to shape his orchestra creatively. While he often took a subtle approach on the piano in his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and complex pieces that showcased the unique abilities of each band member. By designing a framework that allowed for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated phrases that highlighted the distinct styles of individual musicians, Ellington successfully emphasized the ensemble's overall tone while producing coherent and original soundscapes for each piece. His mastery of the distinct sounds of his players and how they blended together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking jazz compositions in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes that Ellington's innovative approach to sound and voice is exemplified in Creole Love Call, which showcases the use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early example demonstrates Ellington's ability to incorporate voice to add texture and depth without lyrics, as well as his skill in complementing the styles of his soloists. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece Creole Love Call is structured into six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response pattern between the voice and reeds, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone before transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody while emphasizing extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in the high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between the voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the 'growl' technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color in Creole Love Call is a characteristic that pervades his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ability to identify and incorporate tone color. A call-and-response phrase between 'Bubber' Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by combining the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe 'Tricky Sam' Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had long harbored an unfulfilled craving that had been with her since her teenage years, dating back to when she was 14. This yearning persisted even after three years, when she was 17, and had evolved from a desire for possessions to a longing for a specific person. However, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys who had shown attention, and their attempts to woo her had only resulted in awkward encounters. This unusual situation left her wondering what could be the cause of her unshakeable desire, a question that had been plaguing her for years. \n\nAs a result, she had spent years pondering various theories, but none were convincing enough to provide her with any conclusive answers. Despite this, she continued to navigate life, raising more questions about her desires.\n\nOrdinarily, her home life was peaceful. Her parents were calm and composed individuals who rarely argued with each other, and even less frequently with their daughter. However, they did occasionally disagree about her desire for independence and her strong, outgoing personality, which was a stark contrast to their calm demeanor. This unique blend of her lively personality and kind nature made her very likable.\n\nBut today was not a typical day at home. As she moved from room to room in search of inspiration, she was startled by a short scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's voice. She rushed into the room, panic rising as she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Upon entering, she saw her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain and repeatedly saying \"Ow\" between short breaths. The daughter quickly rushed to her side and placed a hand on her to offer assistance. With her mother's words laced with urgency, she repeatedly pleaded, \"Ouch, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The daughter understood that her mother was in immense pain and swiftly organized her response, \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up.\" Her mother directed her, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the training she had received, which enabled her to lift her mother and carry her to the car.\n\nA visit to the hospital revealed the overwhelming scents of disinfectant and illness, accompanied by an air of fear. However, the daughter was too preoccupied with helping her mother to notice it. She quickly moved her mother to the hospital bed, called for the doctors, and waited anxiously as they arrived. The medical staff quickly assessed her mother's condition, and the daughter was left to sit and worry.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had fallen from a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet, causing her injury.",
            "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean diet, as reflected by the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed) score, emphasizes high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol intake allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower total and cardiovascular mortality. However, no prior research had explored the specific relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke. This study drew on data from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses, to investigate this connection.\n\nThe research analyzed data from 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated the aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. The study found that over 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period. The validity of the food frequency questionnaires was confirmed through validation studies.\n\nThe study identified reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke through medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and represent long-term dietary intake, the study calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated food frequency questionnaires. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke. The results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women.\n\nOver the 20-year follow-up period, the study identified 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a significantly lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States experienced a severe financial crisis in 2007. This crisis led to a sharp increase in unemployment, a collapse of the housing market, and the downfall of several prominent American corporations. Given the ongoing impact of this crisis, it's essential to examine its causes and explore ways to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The root of the crisis lies in the reckless and uninformed decisions made by policymakers, which forced banks and financial institutions to issue large numbers of subprime loans to the already fragile financial system. This was further exacerbated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were compelled to purchase and repackage these high-risk mortgages into complex financial instruments. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, the banks faced a significant shortage of capital reserves, causing a ripple effect that spread to the broader economy through the repackaged mortgages they had sold.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton administration, which aimed to increase the President's popularity ahead of his re-election bid. To achieve this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, paving the way for the subsequent subprime crisis seven years later. According to a 1999 article by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure to expand lending to low- and moderate-income households while maintaining its profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that this approach could lead to trouble in the event of an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to the one that saved the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the warnings were ignored, leading to the devastating economic consequences that unfolded.\n\nThe use of complex financial instruments, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, further entangled the economy with the housing market. This led to households and financial markets becoming excessively dependent on the housing market, making them highly vulnerable to even minor changes in prices. The housing bubble eventually burst, causing devastating consequences for financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities. The top U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a low price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to adopt commercial banking models subject to stricter regulations. Fannie and Freddie had accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition section of a story - a place where writers either take to the skies with their imagination or face the wrath of readers who lose interest. Dr. Merlin has been known to get frustrated when she finds herself bogged down in too much detail, and it's not the kind of excitement she was aiming for.\n\nAs writers, we've all heard the advice to \"show, don't tell,\" but it's easy to get caught up in lengthy passages of exposition that don't add much to the plot. It's as if there's a pesky inner voice urging us to get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff. However, this isn't the same as the voice that whispers to reveal character details through action and dialogue.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the reader what's happened, usually in a straightforward manner. In film, it often takes the form of one character spewing out a vast amount of information, like a verbal dump. In writing, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine being told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and had her husband brutally murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with the couple only having a couple of lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd want the author to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his love for her through his words and actions. You'd also want to see how the heroine's life changed with him and how she felt about him, especially if the story later highlights this connection. A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character, allowing you to feel her pain when he dies and become more connected to her.\n\nIn essence, you're looking for substance to accompany the basic storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your task to provide that depth. Sometimes, it's tempting to rush through certain details, like introducing a new character with a laundry list of background information, such as his past in the Air Force, his current job, his marriages, and his secret dreams. However, this approach can leave the reader disengaged.",
            "I watched two live newscasts from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The first one, broadcast by NBC 4, covered a developing story about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife. Although the victim's name was not mentioned, a mugshot of Hostettler was shown, depicting a menacing appearance. The segment lasted only two minutes, which seemed adequate given the ongoing nature of the story. The details provided included the fact that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody.\n\nThe following story reported a shooting incident involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, who was left critically injured. No arrests had been made at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. Notably, this story seemed brief, and it's possible that the racial bias observed in the media's coverage may have contributed to this. It has been a recurring observation that when a minority is a victim of a crime, they may not receive the same level of attention as a white victim.\n\nThe next story focused on a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators believed the incident occurred in a specific location and determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle caused the damage. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nA story about the weekend weather forecast followed, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon with temperatures ranging from the mid to low 80s. The segment was relatively short, likely intended as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a suspect described as a dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie and approximately six feet tall and 150 pounds, was sought. It was observed that an unusual emphasis was placed on the suspect's racial description.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the newscast mentioned 300 months. It's unclear whether this was intended to convey a harsher sentence or simply to provide a different numerical representation. The newscast also identified Rodriguez as a Hispanic man, although this detail seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A profound bond exists between brothers, one that is unbreakable and irreversible. This bond is a complex tapestry of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, which are intertwined and often contradictory. The connection between brothers is deeper and more profound than any other relationship, allowing them to see themselves in each other in a way that transcends external perceptions. In moments of crisis, the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether it is marked by good or evil. When these emotions are fully expressed, they come with significant consequences, making it essential to understand and navigate the intricacies of this fraternal link. When one brother can look at the other and see their own reflection, they gain insight into their own character, not as others see them, but as they truly are, through their actions and their consequences. \n\nThis theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis\" through the complex relationships between two brothers. Against the backdrop of a vividly described environment, these two boys embark on a perilous journey, marked by the intense emotions that accompany their bond. The novel portrays the protagonist's and his brother's struggles, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the depth of their feelings and their impact on the protagonist's actions. The story is centered around the protagonist's emotional journey, driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. As he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, the protagonist feels a growing sense of resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who would be his partner in exploration and adventure, but Doodle's frail health, born from a weak heart, makes it impossible for him to participate in the activities that the protagonist had dreamed of. This reality is crushing for the young protagonist, and he is even shown to harbor anger towards Doodle. However, when Doodle smiles, the protagonist's anger gives way to a deep affection, revealing that his love for his brother is a fundamental aspect of his nature. This ambivalence showcases the complexity of the protagonist's emotions and highlights the inherent contradictions that arise from this unique bond.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative system that processes information. As technology has evolved, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a clay tablet, then to a scroll, then to a book, and more recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these comparisons have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions. \n\nInformation processing commences with sensory organs converting physical stimuli into electrical signals. This sensory information undergoes multiple transformations within the brain through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, initial processing involves combining basic elements such as color, orientation, and the object's borders to determine what you see. Subsequent processing utilizes previous decisions to speed up recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to some extent, an attention filter determines its significance and which cognitive processes should have access to it. Although your brain analyzes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy environment. There are various stages of processing, and the results are influenced by attention in a cyclical manner.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, often depending on the type of sensory stimulus it originated from. For instance, verbal input can be encoded in a visual, auditory, or semantic manner. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal passing through a particular sequence of neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved through the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, each based on different disciplines such as human memory retrieval, computer science, or neurophysiology. One such model is the semantic network, where concepts are represented as nodes linked based on their relationships. For example, in this model, the concept of a \"chair\" could be associated with \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and the capitalistic system that perpetuates it in his novel Brave New World. In this dystopian world, individuals prioritize community over personal freedom, and from a young age, they are conditioned to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are unwittingly trapped in a larger scheme, conforming to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Under a Marxist lens, the novel reveals Huxley's concerns about the emerging systems of his time. His use of Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, underscores his commentary on the shortcomings of the economy during his era.\n\nThe novel satirically portrays capitalism through the concept of false consciousness. The common people are kept in the dark about their economic relationships with other classes, focused instead on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control over the working class and laborers, evident in the conditioning of people in Brave New World. The lower classes, ranging from Deltas to Gammas, lack true autonomy, as hypnopædia reinforces their drive for consumption and indulgence above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. The phenomenon of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over various social classes, is also evident in Brave New World, where the lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, effectively buying into an ideology that supports the capitalist structure. In contrast, the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but often choose to accept their status quo. The interactions between social classes in the novel serve as a testament to the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial and lack depth, with characters often being reduced to one-dimensional portrayals. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions, often reduced to comments about physical appearance. The societal classes' contentment with their positions in the hierarchy highlights the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, having spent four and a half semesters on campus. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in East Halls, which is situated towards the eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, located near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. Speaking with an alum who is not much older than me, I learned that the East Halls dorms were previously separated from the rest of the campus by vast expanses of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been developed with sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and health services facility, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. In such a scenario, the most effective solution is often the bicycle. Nevertheless, owning a bike is merely the first step; students must also be willing to use it, and the campus infrastructure should be designed to accommodate the needs of cyclists.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who had taken up bicycling again after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his wonder at why he had ever stopped, remarking that bicycles are an excellent mode of transportation. \"Bikes are great,\" he said. \"For a few years, it wasn't fashionable to ride a bike, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" In addition to its physical benefits, bicycling is a highly efficient way to travel, allowing you to cover 30 miles or more with minimal effort. As many of my peers do, I currently live off-campus, situated approximately the same distance from the campus center as some dorms. One of the most practical decisions I made this year was purchasing a bike. Daily classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, can be reached in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a moderate pace. However, there are challenges associated with using Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my home. While walking is also an option, I find it too time-consuming for my schedule. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, equating to over two and a half hours each week. This would leave me with insufficient time for other activities and responsibilities."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, my ultimate goal is to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been subjected to abuse or neglect, and offer support to struggling families. The values that drive me to excel in this field are rooted in my personal conviction to provide service, respect, and uphold an ethical code of conduct. I am committed to enhancing my professional skills to ensure that I remain a valuable asset in my field, and work towards fostering stronger relationships within my community. These core values are not only essential for social workers but also deeply ingrained in my personal character.\n\nDuring my high school and college years, I was drawn to careers that would allow me to make a difference in the lives of others. However, it wasn't until I witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of denial and unhealthy coping mechanisms that I became determined to explore a career path in social work. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009. Despite initially feeling uncertain about my career path, a pivotal experience that summer changed my perspective. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was seeking refuge from his abusive home life. The next day, he contacted the authorities, and in an effort to offer support, I accompanied him to his parents' residence. I expressed my concerns to the police, who were then faced with limited options. I then spoke with the parents, who downplayed their son's abuse, attributing it to manipulation and trivial disputes. This harrowing experience sparked my resolve to pursue a career in social work, specifically to help families navigate conflicts and provide support to those in need.\n\nAnother fundamental aspect of social work that resonates with me is the pursuit of social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, yet our actions often contradict this ideal. We mourn the loss of unique individuals, yet we strive for conformity. I believe in embracing my individuality and rejecting the pressure to conform. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively challenged social injustices, expressing myself through my style, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights with GSBA, and combating racism and prejudice whenever possible. As a proponent of social justice, I will continue to advocate for those who are marginalized and oppressed.",
            "This paper examines the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors in the context of insomnia. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical aspects of sleep disorders, while the sociocultural model explores the environmental influences and their effects on different demographic groups, including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographics. This review aims to analyze existing research related to these models, explaining the findings and critiquing their strengths and limitations. \n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, or sleep disorders caused by medical issues or substance abuse. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass a range of sleep disorders, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining adequate or restful sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and automatic REM sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with abnormal behaviors and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions include those associated with Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation).\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genetic, heritable, and physiological factors that influence sleep. Recent research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin, which play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The use of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, suggesting that this mechanism can be generalized to humans. This finding implies that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the physical GABAB receptor in humans, which is essential for adequate sleep. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, even without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, this research suggests that the inherited phenotype of the receptor can regulate sleep, and any alterations could naturally disrupt sleep patterns, negatively impacting daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), an auditory condition that affects how the brain processes sound information. First, the disorder's definition is outlined. Then, the process of diagnosis is explained, highlighting common characteristics, or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper explores ways in which a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) refers to the brain's efficiency in processing auditory information. In essence, CAPD is a condition where the brain fails to properly interpret sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. This condition doesn't result from hearing impairment, but rather from the brain's inability to accurately process and separate sounds, such as distinguishing between words or conversation from background noise.\n\nResearch on CAPD dates back to the 1950s. The disorder was initially known as \"auditory imperception\" when researchers first identified it in children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing assessments in 1954. Later, in 1961, Kimura introduced a method of testing called dichotic testing and developed a model explaining the brain's physiology underlying this process. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty localizing sounds in space, differentiating between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, or detecting changes in speech. Additionally, an individual with CAPD may experience sounds being blocked by subsequent sounds or struggle to interpret sound clues. They may also have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information presented.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using systematic observation and various tests of auditory function. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists use a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills. These assessments may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors. However, there is no single, universally accepted tool for diagnosing CAPD, and the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple sounds simultaneously and asking them to differentiate between specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals and measuring the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "The theme of deception is a recurring motif in Twelfth Night, suggesting that while adopting a disguise can facilitate deception, it may ultimately lead to the loss of one's identity if not abandoned. However, the process of revealing a deception can also cause alienation, as individuals may struggle to reconcile their true selves with their relationships with others, who may respond with varying degrees of acceptance or offense. This dilemma is particularly complex when deception involves gender role reversal, raising questions about the motivations behind such actions. In the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is a desperate measure to protect herself from potential threats, as evidenced by her words, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). \n\nAs a result of her disguise, Viola finds herself disconnected from her female support network and confronted with unrequited romantic feelings towards both Olivia and Orsino. Her convincing performance as a man also raises questions about the true nature of Olivia's affections, with some interpretations suggesting that she may be exploring repressed desires. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario based on his masculine appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? While it is more likely that Olivia is satirizing the societal norms of her time, which judged people solely on their appearance, her rapid shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her eventual acceptance of Viola as family (as seen in \"A sister, you are she,\" 5.1.315) further complicates this issue. The play thus offers a nuanced exploration of the consequences of deception, particularly in the context of gender role reversal, and the complex emotions that can arise from it.",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa, is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the German colonial empire's policies and approach to governance varied significantly across its territories, both in terms of geography and in their educational provisions. When Britain took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Meanwhile, German educational efforts in other colonies, such as Kamerun, had been praised by contemporary authors. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, was vastly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in the education of the native population by establishing state schools, in South West Africa, the task of educating the locals was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. However, the government invested heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions. These policy decisions had lasting effects on the region, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies had a notable number of literate and educated Africans, the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. A complex array of social, economic, and political factors contributed to this divergence in educational experiences. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature examining education within the German colonial empire, with the majority of these sources written in German and published during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in the various colonies, while later studies in English expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education across different colonies and providing in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa provided a detailed comparison of the two colonies' educational systems and shed light on the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, albeit with a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. The European population in the region took advantage of these favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 settlers residing in South West Africa by 1913, far outpacing the 5,336 settlers in the next largest colony, East Africa.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded significantly, encompassing a multitude of genres that are challenging to list comprehensively. Furthermore, most genres, such as rock, country, and jazz, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making it increasingly difficult to define their boundaries. The evolution of Heavy Metal rock is a striking example of this trend, as it has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the last 40 years. Characterized by its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, primarily on the darker end of the emotional spectrum, Heavy Metal has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, allowing artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, which has resulted in an ever-growing number of niches within the movement.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is so diverse and multifaceted that it is challenging to pinpoint its core identity. The genre has borrowed elements from other styles, yet its origins are rooted in something distinct. To truly appreciate the diversity of Metal music that exists today, it is essential to understand the essence of the movement and the reasons behind its emergence.\n\nAt its core, Metal is often defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its emphasis on intensity, volume, and theatricality. Metal music often features complex instrumentation, showcasing the technical proficiency of its performers. Additionally, its history is closely tied to the 1970s psychedelic movement, during which artists used drugs as a creative catalyst, resulting in experimental and otherworldly works. This emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion was a departure from the more lighthearted and upbeat nature of mainstream music at the time. Later generations of Metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on intense emotional expression, which is evident in the lyrics of many Metal songs. For instance, the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, exemplifies the darker, more erratic tone that has come to characterize the genre. This song was, in part, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker work, with the Beatles seeking to demonstrate their own capacity for intensity and darkness.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists created their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was already bringing his own visions to life. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's wonder in a fantastical dream world but also reflects Rousseau's own personal aspirations and struggles as an artist. Rousseau's lifelong goal was to gain recognition and acceptance from his peers and art enthusiasts, but he faced a dilemma – should he conform to established styles to be accepted by the art world or stay true to his unique creative vision. This internal struggle is perfectly encapsulated in The Dream, a painting that represents Rousseau's career-long conflict between artistic conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, it's essential to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in northwest France, Rousseau came from a relatively affluent family. He received no formal art training and instead worked as a municipal toll collector for over 40 years. His personal life was marked by tragedy, including the loss of his first wife and many children, leaving him with only one daughter. He turned to painting as a means of coping with his grief and finding a new sense of purpose. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's work was rooted in his own humble background and experiences.\n\nGiven his unconventional path to art and the timing of his career, Rousseau's desire for recognition is understandable. He began painting later in life, around the same time as other prominent artists, including Henri Matisse. While Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid clichés in his work, Rousseau sought to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français. As author Jan Gordon notes, their styles and motivations were distinct, reflecting their individual artistic visions and goals.",
            "Many thinkers have pointed out a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats states in his poem, \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are intricately linked. Much of what we know in life comes from education and experience, but we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics in a more instinctual way, as if they are inherent and can't be taught. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe and understand, rather than prescribe rules or guidelines. Our studies of morality and beauty seek to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than providing a set of rules for creating or judging good art or behavior.\n\nIn fact, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the heart of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussing the value of a piece like the Mona Lisa might focus on specific elements like composition or cultural context, but these aspects don't fully capture why it's considered a masterpiece. When people describe a favorite work of art or literature, they often use phrases like \"There's just something about it\" before offering more detailed analysis. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As writers like Flannery O'Connor and Ludwig Wittgenstein suggest, there's something essential and transcendent that can't be fully expressed.\n\nI propose that this \"something\" – this intangible quality – is the key to the connection between ethics and aesthetics. This transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them. We experience both art and morality most profoundly at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as McKean points out that literature's unique moral quality sets it apart from other art forms. Literature has the power to convey values that are essential to human experience, making it a vital part of our lives.",
            "Today, Germany is a powerful and unified nation with its own distinct culture that spans from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from the Rhine River city of Cologne to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique cultural identity is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes that have shaped the country. \n\nThe origin of the term \"German\" is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and historians. According to Tacitus, the name might be derived from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with Gaulish forces. On the other hand, Julius Caesar is credited with using the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he distinguished between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had yet to encounter. Caesar likely borrowed the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to describe their neighboring tribes. In his writings, Caesar notes that the Germans were a constant thorn in the side of the Gauls, engaging in almost daily battles. Some etymologists propose that the name \"German\" could be related to a spear called a \"ger\" used in warfare, while others suggest it might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus recorded his observations about the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98. He described the Germans as an indigenous people who had not been significantly influenced by immigration or intermarriage with other cultures. Tacitus questioned why anyone would leave more hospitable regions like Asia, Africa, or Italy to settle in the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Germania. Similarly, it was unlikely that Romans would leave their sprawling empire to settle in Germania, instead choosing to send their soldiers and traders to the region to exploit its resources and skills. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their services as soldiers and traders.",
            "I stood there, my mind blank and disengaged from the scene in front of me.  I observed the scene without any emotional attachment, my thoughts floating in and out of my mind at an incredible speed.  It felt like my consciousness was functioning on autopilot, processing the visual information without any personal connection or interpretation. \n\nI had always been fascinated by art, and I had even tried to learn drawing techniques from a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  This book provided step-by-step instructions on understanding the basics of drawing, including the process of interpreting lines.  One specific technique it taught was to frame a picture with a square, simplifying complex scenes into more manageable shapes. \n\nAs I gazed at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't bring myself to mentally impose this technique.  I was too overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of what I saw, and I found myself standing there in awe.  Artists like Picasso and Monet had their distinct styles, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance featured a wide range of colors.  If I was to consider myself an artist, the scene before me had the potential to be the beginning of my masterpiece, Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up the toilet plunger, my hand tightening and relaxing as I prepared to tackle the task.  However, my hand smacked the handle again, and I struggled to dislodge the stubborn clog.  Eventually, I resorted to grabbing a mop, a green tie constricting my neck, and prepared to tackle the unpleasant task.  A few more flushes and some calming moments later, I donned the toilet paper roll as a makeshift glove and reached into the bowl, my hand dipping in like a parent preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "A disturbing trend is emerging: teenagers are dying in car accidents.  Several factors contribute to this alarming statistic among young American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health suggest that a key factor is that a teenager's brain may not be developmentally ready to handle the dangers of driving.  Another crucial factor is the inexperience of driving, which does not only lead to more fatal accidents but also increases the rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  Moreover, when teenagers drive with their peers, the risks escalate.  Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents. \n\nIn an effort to improve road safety, California and other states have introduced temporary provisional licenses for teenagers, restricting their driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers.  However, these measures are seen as temporary solutions.  The fundamental issue lies in the fact that as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically incapable of managing the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.  According to psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, even at 18, the brain is not mature enough to handle the demands of driving.  His research has also revealed that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risk-taking behavior for the thrill of it.  Given this, it makes sense to delay licensing until this behavior subsides.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents will likely continue to rise, potentially reaching catastrophic levels in the coming years.  By 2010, the number of new teen drivers will surge as the Baby-Boomer's children reach driving age. \n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a straightforward process.  Driver's education classes in schools can still be provided to initiate the learning process for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, and a set number of practical driving hours could be required.  This number could be based on the existing requirements in most states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California.  Given that the problem affects a cross-section of states, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country.  The proposed legislation is not a novel concept, but rather a much-needed solution to a pressing issue.",
            "Upon browsing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to analyze all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily utilized creative editing techniques to create illusions. My research mainly focused on identifying the poetic elements in most trick films and examining the distinctive features of a few later ones that broke away from the norm. During this period, trick films were generally shot on a set, confined within a frontal proscenium, used stationary cameras, and adhered to the principle of one shot per film. However, some early 20th-century films experimented with these guidelines by introducing multiple shots.\n\nOne notable trait common to many trick films is their setting within an interior space framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remained static, never moving to follow characters or objects. This composition was inspired by theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. The use of the stage had its limitations, as characters in trick films usually only moved side-to-side, without walking towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side and moved horizontally within the frame, while the camera remained fixed.\n\nThe conventional frontal proscenium composition led to the frequent use of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups were never employed in any of the Edison catalog's trick films, drawing inspiration from theater and vaudeville, where the audience witnessed the entire performance within the stage's borders. In early films, actors usually remained in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, resulting in no close-ups. Most early trick films adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot equating to a single film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricted the narrative or dramatic potential of trick films, which mainly focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts with little storytelling. However, it's worth noting that in trick films, a single conceptual shot could be composed of multiple physical shots to create the illusion of an apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a closer inspection reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an agriculturalist and politician who played a significant role in advocating for Republicanism. His career in both fields instilled in him a strong commitment to individual freedom and a limited government. His conviction in the importance of an agrarian system was the foundation of his views on governance, shaping his opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system. His goal was to preserve and promote the values he believed were essential to a superior way of life.\n\nTaylor was of the opinion that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by existing traditions. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of humanity, which he saw as interconnected and interdependent. As such, he believed these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference. In his view, the concept of the \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical strength and intelligence often exploited others, but he believed this shouldn't be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for the dual nature of human beings, encompassing both good and evil. He firmly held to a dualistic morality, arguing that government, being human, would reflect both virtues and vices. According to Taylor, good principles included protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function equitably, even under the influence of self-interest. However, he recognized that self-interest could be a positive force when it contributed to the public good, but it became detrimental when it led to the exploitation of others. A fair government was essential to balance human nature's inherent evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of corrupting influences.\n\nSimilar to many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He envisioned a Federal government with limited powers and no more rights than those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He was aware that a large Federal government was expensive and potentially despotic, but he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation could lead to corruption without considering the original intent of the Constitution's authors. Additionally, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence a more authentic charter for the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collective of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, a notable decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month of the project, and the reasons behind it are uncertain. Winter's arrival on a New England campus often leads to a decrease in bike and foot traffic, which could be linked to a portion of the drop. Additionally, with the end of the fall semester in December, participants might have overlooked completing the commuter log amidst their busy schedules of finishing schoolwork and grading. The holiday season's onset and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty may have also contributed to the low submissions, as many were not required to be on campus. The return to classes in late January coincided with another low submission period. While it's possible that a project's initial energy and enthusiasm naturally wane over time, the low February numbers were particularly puzzling. In an effort to revitalize the project, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which resulted in an increase in log submissions. This was a significant challenge, as the project faced not only a typical decrease in engagement but also the impact of holiday and semester breaks unique to the higher education setting.\n\nAnother challenge this project, or any commuting initiative, faces is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving. To address this, incentives for alternative modes of commuting must be provided. We offered gift cards to local businesses, but it would be interesting to see how larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, could have influenced participation, potentially offsetting the dip in engagement. Maintaining a consistent prize structure throughout the project didn't yield the desired results. However, increasing the value of prizes over time might have had a more substantial impact. If we had announced additional, high-value prizes in December and January, such as bicycles and hybrid or electric cars, participation and engagement might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but offers a higher degree of flexibility and is traded like a stock on an exchange.  ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, purchase on margin, and buy as few as one share per transaction.  Although these benefits are highly attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the need to pay a commission on any ETF trade, just like a stock order.  One of the benefits of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  When evaluating the benefits of ETF ownership, it's essential for savvy financial investors to assess whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent they do so. \n\nIn this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF provides benefits comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same 10 stocks, and whether alternative configurations of the same stocks could yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming complexity, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  Below, you'll find the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the representativeness of the top 10 stocks as a whole, we can use their current asset percentage to calculate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of Beta and return are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF overall.  Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with lower risk.  However, it's possible that the differences between these portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's notable poems is \"Dream-Land\", where he employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. The term is attributed to Virgil by Thomas Mabbott, who used it to describe an island north of Britain, believed to be the edge of the known world by the Greeks. However, it is likely that Poe drew inspiration from a more contemporary source, as he was well-versed in German literature. \n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is evident in his use of the term \"Thulé\", which is significant because it highlights his connections to Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", notes the similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe. \n\nGoethe was a renowned writer, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust\", published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. Within the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which tells the story of a king who, after the death of his wife, engages in excessive drinking and grief, ultimately deciding to end his life. The similarities between the King of Thulé and the character in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, possibly symbolizing Poe's own struggles with loss and reliance on drinking.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is further evident in the fact that \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Additionally, Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" but uses \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land\" as a bookend, suggesting a connection between the two poems. \n\nReading \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" together reveals a striking companionship between the two works, with both authors exploring themes of loss, loneliness, and a desolate world. The parallels between the two poems are even more pronounced, with both works depicting a world devoid of color and hope. It is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's work through his respect for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the numerous reproductions of Goethe's writings that were widely available after the original publication of \"Faust\".",
            "In California, a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice.  A judge is unlikely to dismiss a customer's claim for punitive damages without considering her case. To be eligible for punitive damages, the customer must show that the manager's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm they could cause, and that these actions were particularly reprehensible. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill because similar incidents had occurred at the store in the past. The manager's failure to clean the spill, despite knowing the potential harm it could cause, may be seen as despicable considering that several slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store over the course of a year. \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the store manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in the store. Martin replied that he was on a break and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Prior to her accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store in 2009. Palmer is suing the store for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the court is considering whether to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been nearly four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, where the topic of whether Islam is a hostile religion sparked intense debate.  This question remains highly relevant today, particularly when looking back at the media's portrayal of Islam before and after the events of 9/11. The shift from a predominantly negative view to an extreme level of tolerance for Islam in the United States is a striking transformation. It is unlikely that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who openly acknowledged his Muslim heritage, would have been considered viable in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography is quite fascinating to me, given the apparent disparity between his historical depiction and the personality traits attributed to him. Prior to reading his biography, I perceived Muhammad as a forceful figure who coerced people into converting to Islam through conquest and domination. However, the biography portrays him as a humble and misunderstood figure who was often humbled by others. According to the narrative, people gradually came to understand the truth of his teachings and sought him out as a result.\n\nThere are some intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. One notable example is when he allegedly multiplied food for forty men using mutton and milk. This storytelling style contributes to the image of Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but rather lived a life of truth and performed miracles. This narrative approach, in my opinion, downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, and may be seen as an attempt to borrow from Jesus' persona.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous accounts that aim to demonstrate how people converted to Islam of their own free will. However, many of these stories are secondhand, as they are passed down through multiple narrators. While the intention behind these stories may be to provide evidence of their truth, they ultimately diminish the accounts and raise suspicions about their credibility.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the portrayal of Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical records paint a different picture, contradicting the image presented in the biography. I find it difficult not to wonder whether Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As the years went by after Jesus' life, the ideas and teachings he promoted during his time were gradually lost in the development of Christian thought.  A broader look at history reveals a trend where Christianity has been diverging further and further from its roots.  Currently, there is a growing awareness and increasing tendency towards progress.  Although traditionalists will stick to their original teachings and resist any deviation, they might not have enough influence to impact the overall shift.  In the years to come, a heightened sense of historical awareness will emerge among Christians, and a desire will arise to distinguish between the true teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that have been incorporated into Christianity over time.  This process might take time, but it is inevitable:  a reversal in the trend of Christian history will occur, and the faith will gradually return to its original form.  There will be a movement that will remove layer upon layer of added doctrine, much like rewinding a clock, until only the core essence of Jesus' message remains.  When this trend spreads to the United States and Europe, it will influence the masses, causing them to adopt a more authentic, Jesus-centered way of worship, free from the influence of later thinkers.  The church institution will remain strong, guiding the way, but the extreme diversification of Christian traditions will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  As a result, regional, denominational, and interpersonal differences will diminish, replaced by a greater sense of unity.  History is replete with remarkable transformations, such as the Roman Empire's shift from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, and the progression of the United States from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  Similarly, the Christian faith is poised for a great reversal, one that will involve a return to its source and a reduction in the diversity that has developed over time.  A crucial aspect of this process will be the interpretation of Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  If we look back far enough, we can see that the Christian faith originated from Judaism, a monotheistic faith based on divinely revealed scripture and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, which existed long before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  However, the Jewish population was not unified; it consisted of various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "The Jungle by Upton Sinclair highlights the inherent self-centered nature of humanity, where individuals prioritize their own interests and well-being above all else, disregarding the welfare of those around them. This is evident in the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who are solely focused on expanding and profiting from their businesses, without regard for the consequences to the environment, workers, or their own lives. Sinclair vividly describes the devastating impact of industrial pollution, as seen in the \"great chimneys belching smoke into the sky,\" and the owners' disregard for the harm caused by animal waste and pollution. The book also reveals the exploitative treatment of employees, who are subjected to grueling working conditions and unpredictable layoffs without any support or compensation.\n\nThis lack of regulation during the time period allowed the factory owners and managers to operate freely, pressuring employees to work at an unsustainable pace and in hazardous conditions. The absence of protective laws and organizations left workers vulnerable and powerless, with limited access to resources or assistance. Even the formation of unions often backfired, benefiting the owners more than the workers. The situation is likened to a system of slavery, where workers are trapped and dependent on the whims of their oppressors, leading to inevitable and widespread immorality.",
            "Authors often employ various techniques to influence readers' emotions and perceptions of significant subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully utilizes multiple techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby to convey certain impressions. One of his methods involves associating an adjective with a noun in a non-conventional way to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Another technique, which Fitzgerald frequently uses, is assigning meaning to symbols, such as colors, and leveraging them to convey specific emotions. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up the meaning behind several colors, including white, gray, and the combination of red and pink. He establishes these color associations at the beginning of the novel and then utilizes them to evoke a specific feeling or reminder in relation to important objects.\n\nFor instance, Fitzgerald associates white and gray with uniformity. In the novel, white is often linked with a sense of refinement and higher social status, while gray represents a more aged and faded quality. Fitzgerald introduces these associations early on by repeatedly using both colors in various contexts. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white attire, such as in the description of Daisy being \"in white\" (8). Other characters like Nick wear white clothing to Gatsby's parties, and Tom is described wearing a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is describing his impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are described as being adorned with primary colors.\n\nFitzgerald further solidifies these color associations by applying them to everyday, unimportant subjects, such as places and people. For example, when Nick commutes to work, he goes down the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56). Fitzgerald also describes common people and places as being white or gray, like the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes. After establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to signify a lack of importance or uniformity. This technique is first employed when describing Daisy, who is initially characterized as being in a white dress in a \"little white roadster\" (74). Through repeated use of these colors, Fitzgerald reinforces the idea that Daisy is more of a uniform, desirable object for Gatsby rather than a fully fleshed-out character.\n\nFitzgerald continues to employ this technique to convey a sense of uniformity around Daisy, using colors to downplay her character. For instance, Daisy is described as having a \"gray haze of her fur collar\" (18) and is again wearing white (115) before Tom and Gatsby's encounter. By using colors in this way, Fitzgerald skillfully manipulates the reader's perception of Daisy and her significance in the novel.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural productivity can be attributed to its pleasant, sunny climate. A variety of crops thrive in this region, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture in San Diego is substantial, resulting in lengthy waiting lists for many local organizations. Organic products such as eggs and milk are also in high demand. Some organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations and allow visitors to engage in recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. \n\nThis type of operation can help a landowner take advantage of government programs while promoting environmental conservation, allowing for recreational use and educational opportunities. Organic farming often has several benefits, including increased biodiversity in the area due to reduced chemical use. However, it can be more labor-intensive and costly in certain aspects compared to conventional farming, including manual pest control, soil fertilization, and higher loss rates. Furthermore, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Additional practices beneficial to local wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, can also be more labor-intensive. As a result, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to optimize both their profits and habitat quality. \n\nThe chosen land is situated near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and spans 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered and declining species such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production over the years. To research possible cost-reducing strategies and wildlife-friendly practices, I selected a property from a real estate website and explored government programs available to small farmers. A nearby organic farm in the same area serves as a model for the types of operations this landowner might aim to establish.",
            "Cultural dynamics play a crucial role in any negotiation, making it essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding. Rather than reducing a culture to oversimplified stereotypes, it's more productive to grasp the significance it holds in the context of the negotiation and how its values will influence the interaction. When engaging with a foreign culture, individuals often relate to it through the lens of their own, resulting in inevitable comparisons.\n\nGaining insight into a culture can involve delving into its history, acknowledging its biases, and accepting its inherent complexities rather than trying to change or judge it. This acceptance is particularly vital during negotiations, especially when one party holds a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for the cultural norms and values of the other party can help bridge any cultural gaps and facilitate a more productive negotiation, even when in a foreign setting.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that cultural boundaries are not solely defined by national or international affiliations. Corporate cultures within a country can be significantly distinct, often shaped by their unique values, work environments, and practices. For instance, some companies prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed atmosphere. These variations can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The differences within American corporate culture, from company to company and even region to region, serve as a testament to the diversity that exists within a particular societal culture.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's core values is crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers. If a culture places a high value on avoiding shame or maintaining communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superiors to secure a successful outcome. Conversely, in a culture that prioritizes the pursuit of a strong bargain, the negotiator may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these generalities prior to the negotiation, one can better tailor their approach to achieve a more effective outcome. It's also beneficial for a negotiator to develop a personal understanding of their counterpart to enhance the negotiation's success.",
            "The phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the foundation of St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas also shares a similar viewpoint, albeit with a differing approach. Since both of their arguments are centered around the same concept, we will assume that both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible to facilitate a fair comparison. This assumption is necessary as their arguments would be rendered incomparable if they were advocating for a generic, non-specific deity. Although both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas present valid points, their arguments lack a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will analyze the central argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's reasoning follows a path of faith, focusing on introspection to find proof of God. He suggests that because God exists within our understanding, it is impossible to conceive of his nonexistence. Although the intricacies of his explanation can be complex and unclear, the core idea is that the evidence for God lies within one's own mind. Anselm proposes that we do not need to look beyond our own consciousness to find truth about God; instead, the existence of this being is self-evident and can be understood by examining the inherent truths we know within ourselves. This concept, which relies on accepting something without empirical proof, is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a different perspective, one that relies solely on reason and empirical evidence to prove the existence of God, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be beneficial for evangelism as it would enable the recruitment of new believers who are persuaded by logic rather than faith. Thomas Aquinas outlines five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through these arguments, he demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity of his existence. He uses the analogy of a completed puzzle to illustrate that one can infer the existence and characteristics of a missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince destined to be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly life, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings led to the establishment of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional sect. This ancient religion, now over 2,500 years old, has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhism is prominent, the annual water-cutting ceremony is a significant event that involves both monks and laypeople, despite the Buddha not teaching about any such celebrations. This divergence is evident in the way the religion has evolved, encompassing everything from surface-level customs to its core teachings. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay perspectives, has seen its principles change over time due to internal and external, hostile and benign forces.\n\nKey terms used throughout this discussion include internal and external forces, where internal forces refer to influences originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, and external forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are driven by a negative perception of Buddhism and aim to harm the community, while benign forces, although neutral in intent, may inadvertently cause harm or benefit. These definitions will be recurring throughout this discussion.\n\nTo understand the essence of Theravada Buddhism, it is crucial to examine its fundamental doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka, consisting of three baskets of texts: the Sutta Pitaka, which contains the discourses; the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which encompasses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include the notion of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes rules for laypeople and monks, with the former adhering to the five precepts (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and sobriety). For monks, there are additional disciplinary rules. The four noble truths are the fundamental principles of Buddhism: first, the truth of suffering; second, the understanding that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "For over five decades, the United States and Mexico experienced a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States invaded and defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. This conflict was a pivotal moment in the history of the two nations, marking a significant turning point in their relationship. However, clashes between the two countries continued to occur until just before World War I, fueled by their differences in culture, tradition, and material interests.\n\nThis scenario is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship, as many nations with shared borders often experience disputes over competing interests. The United States and Mexico are not an exception, as their geographic proximity and cultural differences created a fertile ground for rivalry. Historian David M. Pletcher notes that only Mexico and Cuba have presented long-standing diplomatic challenges to the United States, due to their close geographical proximity and historical conflicts.\n\nOne of the primary sources of tension between the two nations was their differing religious beliefs, which, as Sally Frahm points out, were a major obstacle to their relations in the past. The United States' opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, inherited from the English and Spanish colonial powers, created an ideological divide between the two countries. This ideological struggle was further complicated by the distrust inherited from their former colonial rulers, making it challenging for the two nations to establish friendly relations.\n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico was marked by numerous disputes, with 17 recorded incidents during the 57-year period, as documented by Diehl and Goerts. The majority of these disputes were related to territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. The use of military force by both countries to secure their borders eventually brought an end to these problems.\n\nAccording to Schmitt, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and the US's focus shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the latter part of the 19th century. This marked a significant shift in the nature of their relationship, paving the way for a more cooperative and less confrontational dynamic between the two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suffered a sudden and unexpected illness that left me disabled. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen this profession to find stability, driven by the promise that \"you'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" This mantra resonated with me from adolescence, as I prioritized job security over my true aspirations to be a scientist or journalist.\n\nHowever, life took an unexpected turn when I found myself at the age of 46, single, with little savings and unable to work. After fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I've lost everything that was truly mine. Each day is a struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-esteem, with uncertainty at every turn. Yet, one thing remains certain: I couldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends, who helped me navigate the darkest times.\n\nIn times of crisis, people often feel a false sense of strength that vanishes when disaster strikes. My experience serves as a reminder that life is unpredictable, and no matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should diversify our dependence on the government, I believe that rebuilding trust within our communities would be a more effective approach. Americans should focus on learning to rely on one another and ask for help when needed, rather than trying to go it alone. The idea of rugged individualism, touted by some, is often romanticized, but in reality, our ancestors relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to overcome hardships. Those pioneers who braved the journey across the Rockies in wagon trains found success through collective effort.\n\nWhile preparation is essential, don't underestimate the power of community. I'm prepared with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials, but I also recognize the importance of building relationships with my neighbors. By combining preparedness with a sense of community, we can create a more resilient society.",
            "The underlying reasons for the evolutionary paths of organisms are still not fully understood. Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that scientists were far from being able to define even the simplest organic forms using mathematical language, this remains a challenge to this day. However, recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk shell development, including both their growth and evolution (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research is focused on using mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, in conjunction with experimental studies, to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental changes. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We then created hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA mollusk shell can be thought of as a structure that forms a spiral path over time, spanning 360 degrees of space. The individual turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella. The rate at which whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, with the apex at the tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, with the typical orientation being an apertural view, where the aperture is facing the viewer and the apex is pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture begins. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl. \n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center coordinates and horizontal and vertical radii of each whorl's aperture, we can trace the path of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. With a mathematical formulation in place, we can then modify parameters to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite showing little improvement over the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia remain a pressing concern.  The country's progress in achieving certain Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, is not being matched by gains in child and maternal health, with significant gaps in progress towards the 2015 targets.  The reasons behind these shortcomings are multifaceted and suggest that Indonesia needs to bolster its overall healthcare system rather than solely focusing on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen some advancements in the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion.  However, this metric encompasses traditional practitioners like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complications, contributing to the higher rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the improvements in this area might be misleading, indicating that more work needs to be done.  Furthermore, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases by a healthcare professional has decreased, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, highlighting concerns about the country's healthcare services.\n\nCesarean-section rates in Indonesia remain lower than expected, particularly in rural areas where they stand at 2%, compared to 7% in urban settings.  This disparity underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with a focus on urban areas.  The contrast between the service utilization rates of the wealthiest and poorest quintiles - a 27% gap - also raises concerns about vertical equity, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the shortage of services.  Should Indonesia prioritize strengthening its overall healthcare system or adopt targeted programmatic approaches that focus on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While program-specific approaches may yield faster results and more manageable objectives, they also have drawbacks, such as diverting resources and personnel away from other areas of the health sector.  Moreover, the duplication of services and lack of coordination between programs can lead to administrative burdens and inefficiencies.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the lives of the aristocracy during this period.  However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this traditional mold by incorporating elements of mystery and the unusual. Through these unique narrative devices, the characters in both novels are more deeply developed, providing readers with a better understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\nOne notable example of this can be seen in the mind-bending passage from a scene in Oliver Twist, where the protagonist finds himself caught up in a chaotic and disorienting sequence of events. The scene describes how the main character's thoughts become increasingly jumbled, and he finds himself reliving the traumatic experience of a shooting, which is portrayed as a dream-like state. This sequence highlights Oliver's lack of control over the circumstances surrounding the shooting and the severe toll it has taken on his health. As his senses become numb, the pain and fear become a constant presence, leaving the reader questioning whose actions led to his misfortune. This scene suggests that Oliver has been worn down and is struggling to cope, implying that he has lost the will to fight for control over his life.\n\nSimilarly, a passage from another scene in Oliver Twist describes a day that seems to blend into night, characterized by an eerie silence and a sense of time passing rapidly. This atmosphere of despair is a common thread throughout the novel, as Oliver's experiences continue to weigh heavily on him.",
            "About two years ago, I worked at an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students in various subjects, but I specialized in English and reading. I was approached by an instructor to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading despite being in the third or fourth grade. I was puzzled by his difficulties, as he found some letters easy to pronounce while others were almost impossible for him. This caught my attention, and I soon discovered that Adrian's mother, who only spoke Spanish, was present during our sessions. We managed to communicate using a basic understanding of Spanish, but it was then that I realized Adrian's issue was not with reading, but with knowing the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenges posed by language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It is often not immediately apparent, even for students who speak fluent English, as in Adrian's case. This issue affects many students, and finding a solution is not straightforward. In Adrian's situation, addressing his problem was relatively simple – he needed extra help with English reading, particularly with the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and other methods on their own are insufficient to address the issue. Instead, a combination of these approaches is necessary. \n\nThe dual language system, which is often viewed as a resource-intensive idea, is actually beneficial for all students. Research has shown that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that this approach may not be effective for the majority of students, the reality is that it can benefit all students if implemented widely. However, implementing this system in classrooms requires careful consideration. It is not necessary for all teachers to be bilingual, as that would be unrealistic and impractical. Instead, schools can employ specialized aids, tutors, or support staff who are fluent in multiple languages to help students who need it.",
            "From an early age, many of us are led to believe that there is something greater than ourselves that we can't fully understand. Some people attend church, temple, or explore their own spirituality, while others accept the faith passed down by their parents or reject it entirely. Whatever path we choose, we are on a journey of self-discovery through our individual perspectives on spirituality, searching for guidance and meaning in life. \n\nThis introspection was reflected in a conversation I once had with my father, when I asked him about his favorite type of bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the sound of rain on the tin roof, as the rain poured down the gutters and washed away the plants along the edge of the porch. My father gazed out into the rain, lost in thought, his health visibly declining over the past few months. He seemed disconnected, and I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I was going to miss him, as acknowledging it would make the reality even harder to bear. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in looking out into the rain, trying to find a sense of comfort in the shared moment.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. Although the chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the doctors' predictions, they failed to ease his suffering. I couldn't help but question the value of prolonging his life, wondering what kind of higher power would allow this to happen. Alone at night, I didn't pray, as I had lost faith in a higher being that would listen. \n\nI had chosen not to witness his passing, unable to watch the person who created me leave this world. Instead, I chose to remember my father through the happy memories of his life, not the agony of his death. I also knew that he wouldn't have wanted me to be present during his final moments, so I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for news of his passing. Unfortunately, no one even reached out to me during that difficult time.",
            "Ian Watt describes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its contradictory nature. The Gothic mode has been both criticized for lacking depth and praised for its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime.' Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the original Gothic novel, drew upon the ideas of both ancient and modern romances to create a new genre and literary style. By combining old theatrical elements with modern narrative techniques, Walpole created a unique form of expression, which he referred to as \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic genre often incorporates elements of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the term \"Gothic\" being associated with different peoples, styles, and time periods during the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication. As a result, the term \"Gothic\" was often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements. However, the blending of the theatrical aspects of Gothic literature with the novel's format, which allows readers to delve into the characters' psychologies, has enabled the Gothic genre to endure and remain relevant despite being both old and new to readers.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry, which is derived from medieval ideals of knighthood. In The Castle of Otranto, this concept is both preserved and transformed. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, as it represented the ideal of the brave, honorable, and competent knight. By idealizing and romanticizing the chivalric past, Gothic writers aimed to critique the present and suggest improvements. Walpole, writing during a tumultuous period, was disillusioned with the potential future and possibly felt that the moral and innate goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This sentiment is reflected in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits and is described as a gallant and courteous prince who has suffered nobly.",
            "Supply chain management is a series of interconnected processes that oversee the movement of goods from raw materials to customers, encompassing stages such as production, supply, and distribution. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling the flow of goods to meet customer demands efficiently. Six key components underpin supply chain management: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial stage in the supply chain process, serving as its foundation. It involves defining the when, why, where, and how of production, based on market analysis and customer demand. To gain insights into customer needs, managers analyze market trends, which provide valuable indicators of demand. With a thorough understanding of customer requirements, managers determine the products to produce, their quantities, and the most suitable production locations, taking into account factors like volume and quality. Once production locations are identified, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Every detail in the production process is crucial, as any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses in the long run. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed detailed guides and processes to ensure smooth operations and minimize confusion among employees.\n\nThe second critical element in supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process, and may also opt to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to provide high-quality products while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "A chilling message reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" on a sign held by Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, as she stands alone on a street corner. The sign's contents are a reference to Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962. In 2007, mass street protests erupted, led by Burmese monks donning saffron-colored robes, sparking the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the public began to take notice of the protests, but the situation soon escalated into a violent conflict between the military junta and the monks, with foreign journalists, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, being violently suppressed. According to Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, the actual death toll from the protests is much higher than the reported 13 fatalities, with estimates suggesting thousands of victims.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. The desire to suppress dissent and maintain control has been a recurring theme throughout human history. From the Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule to Japanese emperors being believed to be divine leaders, there are numerous examples of governments attempting to exert total control over their citizens. Even in modern times, world leaders have been known to engage in similar tactics, such as having secret meetings with influential figures. History is replete with instances of brutal crackdowns on dissent, including the infamous 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where estimates of deaths range from several hundred to over 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and moderates, and the atrocities committed during Hitler's reign, which resulted in the systematic persecution and murder of Jews, are other stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz stems from his extended career and his ability to shape his orchestra creatively. While he often took a subtle approach on the piano in his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and complex pieces that showcased the unique abilities of each band member. By designing a framework that allowed for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated phrases that highlighted the distinct styles of individual musicians, Ellington successfully emphasized the ensemble's overall tone while producing coherent and original soundscapes for each piece. His mastery of the distinct sounds of his players and how they blended together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking jazz compositions in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes that Ellington's innovative approach to sound and voice is exemplified in Creole Love Call, which showcases the use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early example demonstrates Ellington's ability to incorporate voice to add texture and depth without lyrics, as well as his skill in complementing the styles of his soloists. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece Creole Love Call is structured into six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response pattern between the voice and reeds, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone before transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody while emphasizing extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in the high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between the voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the 'growl' technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color in Creole Love Call is a characteristic that pervades his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ability to identify and incorporate tone color. A call-and-response phrase between 'Bubber' Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by combining the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe 'Tricky Sam' Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had long harbored an unfulfilled craving that had been with her since her teenage years, dating back to when she was 14. This yearning persisted even after three years, when she was 17, and had evolved from a desire for possessions to a longing for a specific person. However, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys who had shown attention, and their attempts to woo her had only resulted in awkward encounters. This unusual situation left her wondering what could be the cause of her unshakeable desire, a question that had been plaguing her for years. \n\nAs a result, she had spent years pondering various theories, but none were convincing enough to provide her with any conclusive answers. Despite this, she continued to navigate life, raising more questions about her desires.\n\nOrdinarily, her home life was peaceful. Her parents were calm and composed individuals who rarely argued with each other, and even less frequently with their daughter. However, they did occasionally disagree about her desire for independence and her strong, outgoing personality, which was a stark contrast to their calm demeanor. This unique blend of her lively personality and kind nature made her very likable.\n\nBut today was not a typical day at home. As she moved from room to room in search of inspiration, she was startled by a short scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's voice. She rushed into the room, panic rising as she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Upon entering, she saw her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain and repeatedly saying \"Ow\" between short breaths. The daughter quickly rushed to her side and placed a hand on her to offer assistance. With her mother's words laced with urgency, she repeatedly pleaded, \"Ouch, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The daughter understood that her mother was in immense pain and swiftly organized her response, \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up.\" Her mother directed her, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the training she had received, which enabled her to lift her mother and carry her to the car.\n\nA visit to the hospital revealed the overwhelming scents of disinfectant and illness, accompanied by an air of fear. However, the daughter was too preoccupied with helping her mother to notice it. She quickly moved her mother to the hospital bed, called for the doctors, and waited anxiously as they arrived. The medical staff quickly assessed her mother's condition, and the daughter was left to sit and worry.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had fallen from a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet, causing her injury.",
            "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean diet, as reflected by the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed) score, emphasizes high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol intake allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower total and cardiovascular mortality. However, no prior research had explored the specific relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke. This study drew on data from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses, to investigate this connection.\n\nThe research analyzed data from 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated the aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. The study found that over 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period. The validity of the food frequency questionnaires was confirmed through validation studies.\n\nThe study identified reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke through medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and represent long-term dietary intake, the study calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated food frequency questionnaires. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke. The results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women.\n\nOver the 20-year follow-up period, the study identified 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a significantly lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States experienced a severe financial crisis in 2007. This crisis led to a sharp increase in unemployment, a collapse of the housing market, and the downfall of several prominent American corporations. Given the ongoing impact of this crisis, it's essential to examine its causes and explore ways to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The root of the crisis lies in the reckless and uninformed decisions made by policymakers, which forced banks and financial institutions to issue large numbers of subprime loans to the already fragile financial system. This was further exacerbated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were compelled to purchase and repackage these high-risk mortgages into complex financial instruments. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, the banks faced a significant shortage of capital reserves, causing a ripple effect that spread to the broader economy through the repackaged mortgages they had sold.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton administration, which aimed to increase the President's popularity ahead of his re-election bid. To achieve this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, paving the way for the subsequent subprime crisis seven years later. According to a 1999 article by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure to expand lending to low- and moderate-income households while maintaining its profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that this approach could lead to trouble in the event of an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to the one that saved the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the warnings were ignored, leading to the devastating economic consequences that unfolded.\n\nThe use of complex financial instruments, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, further entangled the economy with the housing market. This led to households and financial markets becoming excessively dependent on the housing market, making them highly vulnerable to even minor changes in prices. The housing bubble eventually burst, causing devastating consequences for financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities. The top U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a low price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to adopt commercial banking models subject to stricter regulations. Fannie and Freddie had accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition section of a story - a place where writers either take to the skies with their imagination or face the wrath of readers who lose interest. Dr. Merlin has been known to get frustrated when she finds herself bogged down in too much detail, and it's not the kind of excitement she was aiming for.\n\nAs writers, we've all heard the advice to \"show, don't tell,\" but it's easy to get caught up in lengthy passages of exposition that don't add much to the plot. It's as if there's a pesky inner voice urging us to get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff. However, this isn't the same as the voice that whispers to reveal character details through action and dialogue.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the reader what's happened, usually in a straightforward manner. In film, it often takes the form of one character spewing out a vast amount of information, like a verbal dump. In writing, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine being told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and had her husband brutally murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with the couple only having a couple of lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd want the author to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his love for her through his words and actions. You'd also want to see how the heroine's life changed with him and how she felt about him, especially if the story later highlights this connection. A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character, allowing you to feel her pain when he dies and become more connected to her.\n\nIn essence, you're looking for substance to accompany the basic storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your task to provide that depth. Sometimes, it's tempting to rush through certain details, like introducing a new character with a laundry list of background information, such as his past in the Air Force, his current job, his marriages, and his secret dreams. However, this approach can leave the reader disengaged.",
            "I watched two live newscasts from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The first one, broadcast by NBC 4, covered a developing story about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife. Although the victim's name was not mentioned, a mugshot of Hostettler was shown, depicting a menacing appearance. The segment lasted only two minutes, which seemed adequate given the ongoing nature of the story. The details provided included the fact that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody.\n\nThe following story reported a shooting incident involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, who was left critically injured. No arrests had been made at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. Notably, this story seemed brief, and it's possible that the racial bias observed in the media's coverage may have contributed to this. It has been a recurring observation that when a minority is a victim of a crime, they may not receive the same level of attention as a white victim.\n\nThe next story focused on a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators believed the incident occurred in a specific location and determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle caused the damage. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nA story about the weekend weather forecast followed, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon with temperatures ranging from the mid to low 80s. The segment was relatively short, likely intended as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a suspect described as a dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie and approximately six feet tall and 150 pounds, was sought. It was observed that an unusual emphasis was placed on the suspect's racial description.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the newscast mentioned 300 months. It's unclear whether this was intended to convey a harsher sentence or simply to provide a different numerical representation. The newscast also identified Rodriguez as a Hispanic man, although this detail seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A profound bond exists between brothers, one that is unbreakable and irreversible. This bond is a complex tapestry of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, which are intertwined and often contradictory. The connection between brothers is deeper and more profound than any other relationship, allowing them to see themselves in each other in a way that transcends external perceptions. In moments of crisis, the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether it is marked by good or evil. When these emotions are fully expressed, they come with significant consequences, making it essential to understand and navigate the intricacies of this fraternal link. When one brother can look at the other and see their own reflection, they gain insight into their own character, not as others see them, but as they truly are, through their actions and their consequences. \n\nThis theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis\" through the complex relationships between two brothers. Against the backdrop of a vividly described environment, these two boys embark on a perilous journey, marked by the intense emotions that accompany their bond. The novel portrays the protagonist's and his brother's struggles, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the depth of their feelings and their impact on the protagonist's actions. The story is centered around the protagonist's emotional journey, driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. As he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, the protagonist feels a growing sense of resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who would be his partner in exploration and adventure, but Doodle's frail health, born from a weak heart, makes it impossible for him to participate in the activities that the protagonist had dreamed of. This reality is crushing for the young protagonist, and he is even shown to harbor anger towards Doodle. However, when Doodle smiles, the protagonist's anger gives way to a deep affection, revealing that his love for his brother is a fundamental aspect of his nature. This ambivalence showcases the complexity of the protagonist's emotions and highlights the inherent contradictions that arise from this unique bond.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative system that processes information. As technology has evolved, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a clay tablet, then to a scroll, then to a book, and more recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these comparisons have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions. \n\nInformation processing commences with sensory organs converting physical stimuli into electrical signals. This sensory information undergoes multiple transformations within the brain through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, initial processing involves combining basic elements such as color, orientation, and the object's borders to determine what you see. Subsequent processing utilizes previous decisions to speed up recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to some extent, an attention filter determines its significance and which cognitive processes should have access to it. Although your brain analyzes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy environment. There are various stages of processing, and the results are influenced by attention in a cyclical manner.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, often depending on the type of sensory stimulus it originated from. For instance, verbal input can be encoded in a visual, auditory, or semantic manner. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal passing through a particular sequence of neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved through the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, each based on different disciplines such as human memory retrieval, computer science, or neurophysiology. One such model is the semantic network, where concepts are represented as nodes linked based on their relationships. For example, in this model, the concept of a \"chair\" could be associated with \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and the capitalistic system that perpetuates it in his novel Brave New World. In this dystopian world, individuals prioritize community over personal freedom, and from a young age, they are conditioned to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are unwittingly trapped in a larger scheme, conforming to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Under a Marxist lens, the novel reveals Huxley's concerns about the emerging systems of his time. His use of Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, underscores his commentary on the shortcomings of the economy during his era.\n\nThe novel satirically portrays capitalism through the concept of false consciousness. The common people are kept in the dark about their economic relationships with other classes, focused instead on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control over the working class and laborers, evident in the conditioning of people in Brave New World. The lower classes, ranging from Deltas to Gammas, lack true autonomy, as hypnopædia reinforces their drive for consumption and indulgence above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. The phenomenon of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over various social classes, is also evident in Brave New World, where the lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, effectively buying into an ideology that supports the capitalist structure. In contrast, the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but often choose to accept their status quo. The interactions between social classes in the novel serve as a testament to the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial and lack depth, with characters often being reduced to one-dimensional portrayals. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions, often reduced to comments about physical appearance. The societal classes' contentment with their positions in the hierarchy highlights the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, having spent four and a half semesters on campus. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in East Halls, which is situated towards the eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, located near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. Speaking with an alum who is not much older than me, I learned that the East Halls dorms were previously separated from the rest of the campus by vast expanses of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been developed with sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and health services facility, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. In such a scenario, the most effective solution is often the bicycle. Nevertheless, owning a bike is merely the first step; students must also be willing to use it, and the campus infrastructure should be designed to accommodate the needs of cyclists.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who had taken up bicycling again after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his wonder at why he had ever stopped, remarking that bicycles are an excellent mode of transportation. \"Bikes are great,\" he said. \"For a few years, it wasn't fashionable to ride a bike, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" In addition to its physical benefits, bicycling is a highly efficient way to travel, allowing you to cover 30 miles or more with minimal effort. As many of my peers do, I currently live off-campus, situated approximately the same distance from the campus center as some dorms. One of the most practical decisions I made this year was purchasing a bike. Daily classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, can be reached in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a moderate pace. However, there are challenges associated with using Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my home. While walking is also an option, I find it too time-consuming for my schedule. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, equating to over two and a half hours each week. This would leave me with insufficient time for other activities and responsibilities."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The values that drive me to excel in this field are rooted in my personal conviction to provide service, respect, and uphold an ethical code of conduct. I am committed to enhancing my professional skills to ensure that I remain a valuable asset in my field, and work towards fostering stronger relationships within my community. These core values are not only essential for social workers but also deeply ingrained in my personal character.\n\nDuring my high school and college years, I was drawn to careers that would allow me to make a difference in the lives of others. However, it wasn't until I witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of denial and unhealthy coping mechanisms that I became determined to explore a career path in social work. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009. Despite initially feeling uncertain about my career path, a pivotal experience that summer changed my perspective. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was seeking refuge from his abusive home life. The next day, he contacted the authorities, and in an effort to offer support, I accompanied him to his parents' residence. I expressed my concerns to the police, who were then faced with limited options. I then spoke with the parents, who downplayed their son's abuse, attributing it to manipulation and trivial disputes. This harrowing experience sparked my resolve to pursue a career in social work, specifically to help families navigate conflicts and provide support to those in need.\n\nAnother fundamental aspect of social work that resonates with me is the pursuit of social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, yet our actions often contradict this ideal. We mourn the loss of unique individuals, yet we strive for conformity. I believe in embracing my individuality and rejecting the pressure to conform. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively challenged social injustices, expressing myself through my style, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights with GSBA, and combating racism and prejudice whenever possible. As a proponent of social justice, I will continue to advocate for those who are marginalized and oppressed.",
            "This paper examines the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors in the context of insomnia. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical aspects of sleep disorders, while the sociocultural model explores the environmental influences and their effects on different demographic groups, including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographics. This review aims to analyze existing research related to these models, explaining the findings and critiquing their strengths and limitations. \n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, or sleep disorders caused by medical issues or substance abuse. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass a range of sleep disorders, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining adequate or restful sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and automatic REM sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with abnormal behaviors and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions include those associated with Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation).\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genetic, heritable, and physiological factors that influence sleep. Recent research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin, which play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The use of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, suggesting that this mechanism can be generalized to humans. This finding implies that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the physical GABAB receptor in humans, which is essential for adequate sleep. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, even without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, this research suggests that the inherited phenotype of the receptor can regulate sleep, and any alterations could naturally disrupt sleep patterns, negatively impacting daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), an auditory condition that affects how the brain processes sound information. First, the disorder's definition is outlined. Then, the process of diagnosis is explained, highlighting common characteristics, or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper explores ways in which a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) refers to the brain's efficiency in processing auditory information. In essence, CAPD is a condition where the brain fails to properly interpret sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. This condition doesn't result from hearing impairment, but rather from the brain's inability to accurately process and separate sounds, such as distinguishing between words or conversation from background noise.\n\nResearch on CAPD dates back to the 1950s. The disorder was initially known as \"auditory imperception\" when researchers first identified it in children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing assessments in 1954. Later, in 1961, Kimura introduced a method of testing called dichotic testing and developed a model explaining the brain's physiology underlying this process. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty localizing sounds in space, differentiating between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, or detecting changes in speech. Additionally, an individual with CAPD may experience sounds being blocked by subsequent sounds or struggle to interpret sound clues. They may also have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information presented.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using systematic observation and various tests of auditory function. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists use a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills. These assessments may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors. However, there is no single, universally accepted tool for diagnosing CAPD, and the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple sounds simultaneously and asking them to differentiate between specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals and measuring the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "The theme of deception is a recurring motif in Twelfth Night, suggesting that while adopting a disguise can facilitate deception, it may ultimately lead to the loss of one's identity if not abandoned. However, the process of revealing a deception can also cause alienation, as individuals may struggle to reconcile their true selves with their relationships with others, who may respond with varying degrees of acceptance or offense. This dilemma is particularly complex when deception involves gender role reversal, raising questions about the motivations behind such actions. In the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is a desperate measure to protect herself from potential threats, as evidenced by her words, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). \n\nAs a result of her disguise, Viola finds herself disconnected from her female support network and confronted with unrequited romantic feelings towards both Olivia and Orsino. Her convincing performance as a man also raises questions about the true nature of Olivia's affections, with some interpretations suggesting that she may be exploring repressed desires. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario based on his masculine appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? While it is more likely that Olivia is satirizing the societal norms of her time, which judged people solely on their appearance, her rapid shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her eventual acceptance of Viola as family (as seen in \"A sister, you are she,\" 5.1.315) further complicates this issue. The play thus offers a nuanced exploration of the consequences of deception, particularly in the context of gender role reversal, and the complex emotions that can arise from it.",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa, is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the German colonial empire's policies and approach to governance varied significantly across its territories, both in terms of geography and in their educational provisions. When Britain took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Meanwhile, German educational efforts in other colonies, such as Kamerun, had been praised by contemporary authors. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, was vastly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in the education of the native population by establishing state schools, in South West Africa, the task of educating the locals was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. However, the government invested heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions. These policy decisions had lasting effects on the region, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies had a notable number of literate and educated Africans, the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. A complex array of social, economic, and political factors contributed to this divergence in educational experiences. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature examining education within the German colonial empire, with the majority of these sources written in German and published during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in the various colonies, while later studies in English expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education across different colonies and providing in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa provided a detailed comparison of the two colonies' educational systems and shed light on the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, albeit with a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. The European population in the region took advantage of these favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 settlers residing in South West Africa by 1913, far outpacing the 5,336 settlers in the next largest colony, East Africa.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded significantly, encompassing a multitude of genres that are challenging to list comprehensively. Furthermore, most genres, such as rock, country, and jazz, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making it increasingly difficult to define their boundaries. The evolution of Heavy Metal rock is a striking example of this trend, as it has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the last 40 years. Characterized by its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, primarily on the darker end of the emotional spectrum, Heavy Metal has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, allowing artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, which has resulted in an ever-growing number of niches within the movement.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is so diverse and multifaceted that it is challenging to pinpoint its core identity. The genre has borrowed elements from other styles, yet its origins are rooted in something distinct. To truly appreciate the diversity of Metal music that exists today, it is essential to understand the essence of the movement and the reasons behind its emergence.\n\nAt its core, Metal is often defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its emphasis on intensity, volume, and theatricality. Metal music often features complex instrumentation, showcasing the technical proficiency of its performers. Additionally, its history is closely tied to the 1970s psychedelic movement, during which artists used drugs as a creative catalyst, resulting in experimental and otherworldly works. This emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion was a departure from the more lighthearted and upbeat nature of mainstream music at the time. Later generations of Metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on intense emotional expression, which is evident in the lyrics of many Metal songs. For instance, the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, exemplifies the darker, more erratic tone that has come to characterize the genre. This song was, in part, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker work, with the Beatles seeking to demonstrate their own capacity for intensity and darkness.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists created their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was already bringing his own visions to life. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's wonder in a fantastical dream world but also reflects Rousseau's own personal aspirations and struggles as an artist. Rousseau's lifelong goal was to gain recognition and acceptance from his peers and art enthusiasts, but he faced a dilemma – should he conform to established styles to be accepted by the art world or stay true to his unique creative vision. This internal struggle is perfectly encapsulated in The Dream, a painting that represents Rousseau's career-long conflict between artistic conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, it's essential to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in northwest France, Rousseau came from a relatively affluent family. He received no formal art training and instead worked as a municipal toll collector for over 40 years. His personal life was marked by tragedy, including the loss of his first wife and many children, leaving him with only one daughter. He turned to painting as a means of coping with his grief and finding a new sense of purpose. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's work was rooted in his own humble background and experiences.\n\nGiven his unconventional path to art and the timing of his career, Rousseau's desire for recognition is understandable. He began painting later in life, around the same time as other prominent artists, including Henri Matisse. While Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid clichés in his work, Rousseau sought to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français. As author Jan Gordon notes, their styles and motivations were distinct, reflecting their individual artistic visions and goals.",
            "Many thinkers have pointed out a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats states in his poem, \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are intricately linked. Much of what we know in life comes from education and experience, but we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics in a more instinctual way, as if they are inherent and can't be taught. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe and understand, rather than prescribe rules or guidelines. Our studies of morality and beauty seek to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than providing a set of rules for creating or judging good art or behavior.\n\nIn fact, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the heart of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussing the value of a piece like the Mona Lisa might focus on specific elements like composition or cultural context, but these aspects don't fully capture why it's considered a masterpiece. When people describe a favorite work of art or literature, they often use phrases like \"There's just something about it\" before offering more detailed analysis. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As writers like Flannery O'Connor and Ludwig Wittgenstein suggest, there's something essential and transcendent that can't be fully expressed.\n\nI propose that this \"something\" – this intangible quality – is the key to the connection between ethics and aesthetics. This transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them. We experience both art and morality most profoundly at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as McKean points out that literature's unique moral quality sets it apart from other art forms. Literature has the power to convey values that are essential to human experience, making it a vital part of our lives.",
            "Today, Germany is a powerful and unified nation with its own distinct culture that spans from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from the Rhine River city of Cologne to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique cultural identity is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes that have shaped the country. \n\nThe origin of the term \"German\" is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and historians. According to Tacitus, the name might be derived from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with Gaulish forces. On the other hand, Julius Caesar is credited with using the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he distinguished between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had yet to encounter. Caesar likely borrowed the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to describe their neighboring tribes. In his writings, Caesar notes that the Germans were a constant thorn in the side of the Gauls, engaging in almost daily battles. Some etymologists propose that the name \"German\" could be related to a spear called a \"ger\" used in warfare, while others suggest it might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus recorded his observations about the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98. He described the Germans as an indigenous people who had not been significantly influenced by immigration or intermarriage with other cultures. Tacitus questioned why anyone would leave more hospitable regions like Asia, Africa, or Italy to settle in the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Germania. Similarly, it was unlikely that Romans would leave their sprawling empire to settle in Germania, instead choosing to send their soldiers and traders to the region to exploit its resources and skills. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their services as soldiers and traders.",
            "I stood there, my mind blank and disengaged from the scene in front of me.  I observed the scene without any emotional attachment, my thoughts floating in and out of my mind at an incredible speed.  It felt like my consciousness was functioning on autopilot, processing the visual information without any personal connection or interpretation. \n\nI had always been fascinated by art, and I had even tried to learn drawing techniques from a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  This book provided step-by-step instructions on understanding the basics of drawing, including the process of interpreting lines.  One specific technique it taught was to frame a picture with a square, simplifying complex scenes into more manageable shapes. \n\nAs I gazed at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't bring myself to mentally impose this technique.  I was too overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of what I saw, and I found myself standing there in awe.  Artists like Picasso and Monet had their distinct styles, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance featured a wide range of colors.  If I was to consider myself an artist, the scene before me had the potential to be the beginning of my masterpiece, Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up the toilet plunger, my hand tightening and relaxing as I prepared to tackle the task.  However, my hand smacked the handle again, and I struggled to dislodge the stubborn clog.  Eventually, I resorted to grabbing a mop, a green tie constricting my neck, and prepared to tackle the unpleasant task.  A few more flushes and some calming moments later, I donned the toilet paper roll as a makeshift glove and reached into the bowl, my hand dipping in like a parent preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "A disturbing trend is emerging: teenagers are dying in car accidents.  Several factors contribute to this alarming statistic among young American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health suggest that a key factor is that a teenager's brain may not be developmentally ready to handle the dangers of driving.  Another crucial factor is the inexperience of driving, which does not only lead to more fatal accidents but also increases the rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  Moreover, when teenagers drive with their peers, the risks escalate.  Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents. \n\nIn an effort to improve road safety, California and other states have introduced temporary provisional licenses for teenagers, restricting their driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers.  However, these measures are seen as temporary solutions.  The fundamental issue lies in the fact that as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically incapable of managing the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.  According to psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, even at 18, the brain is not mature enough to handle the demands of driving.  His research has also revealed that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risk-taking behavior for the thrill of it.  Given this, it makes sense to delay licensing until this behavior subsides.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents will likely continue to rise, potentially reaching catastrophic levels in the coming years.  By 2010, the number of new teen drivers will surge as the Baby-Boomer's children reach driving age. \n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a straightforward process.  Driver's education classes in schools can still be provided to initiate the learning process for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, and a set number of practical driving hours could be required.  This number could be based on the existing requirements in most states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California.  Given that the problem affects a cross-section of states, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country.  The proposed legislation is not a novel concept, but rather a much-needed solution to a pressing issue.",
            "Upon browsing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to analyze all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily utilized creative editing techniques to create illusions. My research mainly focused on identifying the poetic elements in most trick films and examining the distinctive features of a few later ones that broke away from the norm. During this period, trick films were generally shot on a set, confined within a frontal proscenium, used stationary cameras, and adhered to the principle of one shot per film. However, some early 20th-century films experimented with these guidelines by introducing multiple shots.\n\nOne notable trait common to many trick films is their setting within an interior space framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remained static, never moving to follow characters or objects. This composition was inspired by theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. The use of the stage had its limitations, as characters in trick films usually only moved side-to-side, without walking towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side and moved horizontally within the frame, while the camera remained fixed.\n\nThe conventional frontal proscenium composition led to the frequent use of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups were never employed in any of the Edison catalog's trick films, drawing inspiration from theater and vaudeville, where the audience witnessed the entire performance within the stage's borders. In early films, actors usually remained in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, resulting in no close-ups. Most early trick films adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot equating to a single film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricted the narrative or dramatic potential of trick films, which mainly focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts with little storytelling. However, it's worth noting that in trick films, a single conceptual shot could be composed of multiple physical shots to create the illusion of an apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a closer inspection reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an agriculturalist and politician who played a significant role in advocating for Republicanism. His career in both fields instilled in him a strong commitment to individual freedom and a limited government. His conviction in the importance of an agrarian system was the foundation of his views on governance, shaping his opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system. His goal was to preserve and promote the values he believed were essential to a superior way of life.\n\nTaylor was of the opinion that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by existing traditions. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of humanity, which he saw as interconnected and interdependent. As such, he believed these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference. In his view, the concept of the \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical strength and intelligence often exploited others, but he believed this shouldn't be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for the dual nature of human beings, encompassing both good and evil. He firmly held to a dualistic morality, arguing that government, being human, would reflect both virtues and vices. According to Taylor, good principles included protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function equitably, even under the influence of self-interest. However, he recognized that self-interest could be a positive force when it contributed to the public good, but it became detrimental when it led to the exploitation of others. A fair government was essential to balance human nature's inherent evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of corrupting influences.\n\nSimilar to many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He envisioned a Federal government with limited powers and no more rights than those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He was aware that a large Federal government was expensive and potentially despotic, but he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation could lead to corruption without considering the original intent of the Constitution's authors. Additionally, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence a more authentic charter for the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collective of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, a notable decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month of the project, and the reasons behind it are uncertain. Winter's arrival on a New England campus often leads to a decrease in bike and foot traffic, which could be linked to a portion of the drop. Additionally, with the end of the fall semester in December, participants might have overlooked completing the commuter log amidst their busy schedules of finishing schoolwork and grading. The holiday season's onset and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty may have also contributed to the low submissions, as many were not required to be on campus. The return to classes in late January coincided with another low submission period. While it's possible that a project's initial energy and enthusiasm naturally wane over time, the low February numbers were particularly puzzling. In an effort to revitalize the project, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which resulted in an increase in log submissions. This was a significant challenge, as the project faced not only a typical decrease in engagement but also the impact of holiday and semester breaks unique to the higher education setting.\n\nAnother challenge this project, or any commuting initiative, faces is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving. To address this, incentives for alternative modes of commuting must be provided. We offered gift cards to local businesses, but it would be interesting to see how larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, could have influenced participation, potentially offsetting the dip in engagement. Maintaining a consistent prize structure throughout the project didn't yield the desired results. However, increasing the value of prizes over time might have had a more substantial impact. If we had announced additional, high-value prizes in December and January, such as bicycles and hybrid or electric cars, participation and engagement might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but offers a higher degree of flexibility and is traded like a stock on an exchange.  ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, purchase on margin, and buy as few as one share per transaction.  Although these benefits are highly attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the need to pay a commission on any ETF trade, just like a stock order.  One of the benefits of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  When evaluating the benefits of ETF ownership, it's essential for savvy financial investors to assess whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent they do so. \n\nIn this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF provides benefits comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same 10 stocks, and whether alternative configurations of the same stocks could yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming complexity, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  Below, you'll find the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the representativeness of the top 10 stocks as a whole, we can use their current asset percentage to calculate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of Beta and return are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF overall.  Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with lower risk.  However, it's possible that the differences between these portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's notable poems is \"Dream-Land\", where he employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. The term is attributed to Virgil by Thomas Mabbott, who used it to describe an island north of Britain, believed to be the edge of the known world by the Greeks. However, it is likely that Poe drew inspiration from a more contemporary source, as he was well-versed in German literature. \n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is evident in his use of the term \"Thulé\", which is significant because it highlights his connections to Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", notes the similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe. \n\nGoethe was a renowned writer, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust\", published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. Within the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which tells the story of a king who, after the death of his wife, engages in excessive drinking and grief, ultimately deciding to end his life. The similarities between the King of Thulé and the character in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, possibly symbolizing Poe's own struggles with loss and reliance on drinking.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is further evident in the fact that \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Additionally, Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" but uses \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land\" as a bookend, suggesting a connection between the two poems. \n\nReading \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" together reveals a striking companionship between the two works, with both authors exploring themes of loss, loneliness, and a desolate world. The parallels between the two poems are even more pronounced, with both works depicting a world devoid of color and hope. It is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's work through his respect for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the numerous reproductions of Goethe's writings that were widely available after the original publication of \"Faust\".",
            "In California, a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice.  A judge is unlikely to dismiss a customer's claim for punitive damages without considering her case. To be eligible for punitive damages, the customer must show that the manager's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm they could cause, and that these actions were particularly reprehensible. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill because similar incidents had occurred at the store in the past. The manager's failure to clean the spill, despite knowing the potential harm it could cause, may be seen as despicable considering that several slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store over the course of a year. \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the store manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in the store. Martin replied that he was on a break and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Prior to her accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store in 2009. Palmer is suing the store for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the court is considering whether to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been nearly four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, where the topic of whether Islam is a hostile religion sparked intense debate.  This question remains highly relevant today, particularly when looking back at the media's portrayal of Islam before and after the events of 9/11. The shift from a predominantly negative view to an extreme level of tolerance for Islam in the United States is a striking transformation. It is unlikely that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who openly acknowledged his Muslim heritage, would have been considered viable in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography is quite fascinating to me, given the apparent disparity between his historical depiction and the personality traits attributed to him. Prior to reading his biography, I perceived Muhammad as a forceful figure who coerced people into converting to Islam through conquest and domination. However, the biography portrays him as a humble and misunderstood figure who was often humbled by others. According to the narrative, people gradually came to understand the truth of his teachings and sought him out as a result.\n\nThere are some intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. One notable example is when he allegedly multiplied food for forty men using mutton and milk. This storytelling style contributes to the image of Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but rather lived a life of truth and performed miracles. This narrative approach, in my opinion, downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, and may be seen as an attempt to borrow from Jesus' persona.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous accounts that aim to demonstrate how people converted to Islam of their own free will. However, many of these stories are secondhand, as they are passed down through multiple narrators. While the intention behind these stories may be to provide evidence of their truth, they ultimately diminish the accounts and raise suspicions about their credibility.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the portrayal of Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical records paint a different picture, contradicting the image presented in the biography. I find it difficult not to wonder whether Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As the years went by after Jesus' life, the ideas and teachings he promoted during his time were gradually lost in the development of Christian thought.  A broader look at history reveals a trend where Christianity has been diverging further and further from its roots.  Currently, there is a growing awareness and increasing tendency towards progress.  Although traditionalists will stick to their original teachings and resist any deviation, they might not have enough influence to impact the overall shift.  In the years to come, a heightened sense of historical awareness will emerge among Christians, and a desire will arise to distinguish between the true teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that have been incorporated into Christianity over time.  This process might take time, but it is inevitable:  a reversal in the trend of Christian history will occur, and the faith will gradually return to its original form.  There will be a movement that will remove layer upon layer of added doctrine, much like rewinding a clock, until only the core essence of Jesus' message remains.  When this trend spreads to the United States and Europe, it will influence the masses, causing them to adopt a more authentic, Jesus-centered way of worship, free from the influence of later thinkers.  The church institution will remain strong, guiding the way, but the extreme diversification of Christian traditions will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  As a result, regional, denominational, and interpersonal differences will diminish, replaced by a greater sense of unity.  History is replete with remarkable transformations, such as the Roman Empire's shift from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, and the progression of the United States from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  Similarly, the Christian faith is poised for a great reversal, one that will involve a return to its source and a reduction in the diversity that has developed over time.  A crucial aspect of this process will be the interpretation of Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  If we look back far enough, we can see that the Christian faith originated from Judaism, a monotheistic faith based on divinely revealed scripture and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, which existed long before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  However, the Jewish population was not unified; it consisted of various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "The Jungle by Upton Sinclair highlights the inherent self-centered nature of humanity, where individuals prioritize their own interests and well-being above all else, disregarding the welfare of those around them. This is evident in the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who are solely focused on expanding and profiting from their businesses, without regard for the consequences to the environment, workers, or their own lives. Sinclair vividly describes the devastating impact of industrial pollution, as seen in the \"great chimneys belching smoke into the sky,\" and the owners' disregard for the harm caused by animal waste and pollution. The book also reveals the exploitative treatment of employees, who are subjected to grueling working conditions and unpredictable layoffs without any support or compensation.\n\nThis lack of regulation during the time period allowed the factory owners and managers to operate freely, pressuring employees to work at an unsustainable pace and in hazardous conditions. The absence of protective laws and organizations left workers vulnerable and powerless, with limited access to resources or assistance. Even the formation of unions often backfired, benefiting the owners more than the workers. The situation is likened to a system of slavery, where workers are trapped and dependent on the whims of their oppressors, leading to inevitable and widespread immorality.",
            "Authors often employ various techniques to influence readers' emotions and perceptions of significant subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully utilizes multiple techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby to convey certain impressions. One of his methods involves associating an adjective with a noun in a non-conventional way to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Another technique, which Fitzgerald frequently uses, is assigning meaning to symbols, such as colors, and leveraging them to convey specific emotions. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up the meaning behind several colors, including white, gray, and the combination of red and pink. He establishes these color associations at the beginning of the novel and then utilizes them to evoke a specific feeling or reminder in relation to important objects.\n\nFor instance, Fitzgerald associates white and gray with uniformity. In the novel, white is often linked with a sense of refinement and higher social status, while gray represents a more aged and faded quality. Fitzgerald introduces these associations early on by repeatedly using both colors in various contexts. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white attire, such as in the description of Daisy being \"in white\" (8). Other characters like Nick wear white clothing to Gatsby's parties, and Tom is described wearing a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is describing his impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are described as being adorned with primary colors.\n\nFitzgerald further solidifies these color associations by applying them to everyday, unimportant subjects, such as places and people. For example, when Nick commutes to work, he goes down the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56). Fitzgerald also describes common people and places as being white or gray, like the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes. After establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to signify a lack of importance or uniformity. This technique is first employed when describing Daisy, who is initially characterized as being in a white dress in a \"little white roadster\" (74). Through repeated use of these colors, Fitzgerald reinforces the idea that Daisy is more of a uniform, desirable object for Gatsby rather than a fully fleshed-out character.\n\nFitzgerald continues to employ this technique to convey a sense of uniformity around Daisy, using colors to downplay her character. For instance, Daisy is described as having a \"gray haze of her fur collar\" (18) and is again wearing white (115) before Tom and Gatsby's encounter. By using colors in this way, Fitzgerald skillfully manipulates the reader's perception of Daisy and her significance in the novel.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural productivity can be attributed to its pleasant, sunny climate. A variety of crops thrive in this region, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture in San Diego is substantial, resulting in lengthy waiting lists for many local organizations. Organic products such as eggs and milk are also in high demand. Some organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations and allow visitors to engage in recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. \n\nThis type of operation can help a landowner take advantage of government programs while promoting environmental conservation, allowing for recreational use and educational opportunities. Organic farming often has several benefits, including increased biodiversity in the area due to reduced chemical use. However, it can be more labor-intensive and costly in certain aspects compared to conventional farming, including manual pest control, soil fertilization, and higher loss rates. Furthermore, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Additional practices beneficial to local wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, can also be more labor-intensive. As a result, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to optimize both their profits and habitat quality. \n\nThe chosen land is situated near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and spans 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered and declining species such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production over the years. To research possible cost-reducing strategies and wildlife-friendly practices, I selected a property from a real estate website and explored government programs available to small farmers. A nearby organic farm in the same area serves as a model for the types of operations this landowner might aim to establish.",
            "Cultural dynamics play a crucial role in any negotiation, making it essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding. Rather than reducing a culture to oversimplified stereotypes, it's more productive to grasp the significance it holds in the context of the negotiation and how its values will influence the interaction. When engaging with a foreign culture, individuals often relate to it through the lens of their own, resulting in inevitable comparisons.\n\nGaining insight into a culture can involve delving into its history, acknowledging its biases, and accepting its inherent complexities rather than trying to change or judge it. This acceptance is particularly vital during negotiations, especially when one party holds a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for the cultural norms and values of the other party can help bridge any cultural gaps and facilitate a more productive negotiation, even when in a foreign setting.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that cultural boundaries are not solely defined by national or international affiliations. Corporate cultures within a country can be significantly distinct, often shaped by their unique values, work environments, and practices. For instance, some companies prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed atmosphere. These variations can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The differences within American corporate culture, from company to company and even region to region, serve as a testament to the diversity that exists within a particular societal culture.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's core values is crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers. If a culture places a high value on avoiding shame or maintaining communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superiors to secure a successful outcome. Conversely, in a culture that prioritizes the pursuit of a strong bargain, the negotiator may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these generalities prior to the negotiation, one can better tailor their approach to achieve a more effective outcome. It's also beneficial for a negotiator to develop a personal understanding of their counterpart to enhance the negotiation's success.",
            "The phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the foundation of St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas also shares a similar viewpoint, albeit with a differing approach. Since both of their arguments are centered around the same concept, we will assume that both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible to facilitate a fair comparison. This assumption is necessary as their arguments would be rendered incomparable if they were advocating for a generic, non-specific deity. Although both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas present valid points, their arguments lack a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will analyze the central argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's reasoning follows a path of faith, focusing on introspection to find proof of God. He suggests that because God exists within our understanding, it is impossible to conceive of his nonexistence. Although the intricacies of his explanation can be complex and unclear, the core idea is that the evidence for God lies within one's own mind. Anselm proposes that we do not need to look beyond our own consciousness to find truth about God; instead, the existence of this being is self-evident and can be understood by examining the inherent truths we know within ourselves. This concept, which relies on accepting something without empirical proof, is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a different perspective, one that relies solely on reason and empirical evidence to prove the existence of God, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be beneficial for evangelism as it would enable the recruitment of new believers who are persuaded by logic rather than faith. Thomas Aquinas outlines five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through these arguments, he demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity of his existence. He uses the analogy of a completed puzzle to illustrate that one can infer the existence and characteristics of a missing piece without actually seeing it.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince destined to be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly life, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings led to the establishment of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional sect. This ancient religion, now over 2,500 years old, has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhism is prominent, the annual water-cutting ceremony is a significant event that involves both monks and laypeople, despite the Buddha not teaching about any such celebrations. This divergence is evident in the way the religion has evolved, encompassing everything from surface-level customs to its core teachings. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay perspectives, has seen its principles change over time due to internal and external, hostile and benign forces.\n\nKey terms used throughout this discussion include internal and external forces, where internal forces refer to influences originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, and external forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are driven by a negative perception of Buddhism and aim to harm the community, while benign forces, although neutral in intent, may inadvertently cause harm or benefit. These definitions will be recurring throughout this discussion.\n\nTo understand the essence of Theravada Buddhism, it is crucial to examine its fundamental doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka, consisting of three baskets of texts: the Sutta Pitaka, which contains the discourses; the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which encompasses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include the notion of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes rules for laypeople and monks, with the former adhering to the five precepts (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and sobriety). For monks, there are additional disciplinary rules. The four noble truths are the fundamental principles of Buddhism: first, the truth of suffering; second, the understanding that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "For over five decades, the United States and Mexico experienced a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States invaded and defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. This conflict was a pivotal moment in the history of the two nations, marking a significant turning point in their relationship. However, clashes between the two countries continued to occur until just before World War I, fueled by their differences in culture, tradition, and material interests.\n\nThis scenario is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship, as many nations with shared borders often experience disputes over competing interests. The United States and Mexico are not an exception, as their geographic proximity and cultural differences created a fertile ground for rivalry. Historian David M. Pletcher notes that only Mexico and Cuba have presented long-standing diplomatic challenges to the United States, due to their close geographical proximity and historical conflicts.\n\nOne of the primary sources of tension between the two nations was their differing religious beliefs, which, as Sally Frahm points out, were a major obstacle to their relations in the past. The United States' opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, inherited from the English and Spanish colonial powers, created an ideological divide between the two countries. This ideological struggle was further complicated by the distrust inherited from their former colonial rulers, making it challenging for the two nations to establish friendly relations.\n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico was marked by numerous disputes, with 17 recorded incidents during the 57-year period, as documented by Diehl and Goerts. The majority of these disputes were related to territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. The use of military force by both countries to secure their borders eventually brought an end to these problems.\n\nAccording to Schmitt, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and the US's focus shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the latter part of the 19th century. This marked a significant shift in the nature of their relationship, paving the way for a more cooperative and less confrontational dynamic between the two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I suffered a sudden and unexpected illness that left me disabled. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen this profession to find stability, driven by the promise that \"you'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" This mantra resonated with me from adolescence, as I prioritized job security over my true aspirations to be a scientist or journalist.\n\nHowever, life took an unexpected turn when I found myself at the age of 46, single, with little savings and unable to work. After fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I've lost everything that was truly mine. Each day is a struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-esteem, with uncertainty at every turn. Yet, one thing remains certain: I couldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends, who helped me navigate the darkest times.\n\nIn times of crisis, people often feel a false sense of strength that vanishes when disaster strikes. My experience serves as a reminder that life is unpredictable, and no matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should diversify our dependence on the government, I believe that rebuilding trust within our communities would be a more effective approach. Americans should focus on learning to rely on one another and ask for help when needed, rather than trying to go it alone. The idea of rugged individualism, touted by some, is often romanticized, but in reality, our ancestors relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to overcome hardships. Those pioneers who braved the journey across the Rockies in wagon trains found success through collective effort.\n\nWhile preparation is essential, don't underestimate the power of community. I'm prepared with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials, but I also recognize the importance of building relationships with my neighbors. By combining preparedness with a sense of community, we can create a more resilient society.",
            "The underlying reasons for the evolutionary paths of organisms are still not fully understood. Although D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that scientists were far from being able to define even the simplest organic forms using mathematical language, this remains a challenge to this day. However, recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk shell development, including both their growth and evolution (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research is focused on using mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, in conjunction with experimental studies, to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental changes. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We then created hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA mollusk shell can be thought of as a structure that forms a spiral path over time, spanning 360 degrees of space. The individual turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are arranged in a spiral pattern around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella. The rate at which whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, with the apex at the tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, with the typical orientation being an apertural view, where the aperture is facing the viewer and the apex is pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture begins. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl. \n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center coordinates and horizontal and vertical radii of each whorl's aperture, we can trace the path of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. With a mathematical formulation in place, we can then modify parameters to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite showing little improvement over the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia remain a pressing concern.  The country's progress in achieving certain Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, is not being matched by gains in child and maternal health, with significant gaps in progress towards the 2015 targets.  The reasons behind these shortcomings are multifaceted and suggest that Indonesia needs to bolster its overall healthcare system rather than solely focusing on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen some advancements in the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion.  However, this metric encompasses traditional practitioners like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complications, contributing to the higher rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the improvements in this area might be misleading, indicating that more work needs to be done.  Furthermore, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases by a healthcare professional has decreased, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, highlighting concerns about the country's healthcare services.\n\nCesarean-section rates in Indonesia remain lower than expected, particularly in rural areas where they stand at 2%, compared to 7% in urban settings.  This disparity underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with a focus on urban areas.  The contrast between the service utilization rates of the wealthiest and poorest quintiles - a 27% gap - also raises concerns about vertical equity, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the shortage of services.  Should Indonesia prioritize strengthening its overall healthcare system or adopt targeted programmatic approaches that focus on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While program-specific approaches may yield faster results and more manageable objectives, they also have drawbacks, such as diverting resources and personnel away from other areas of the health sector.  Moreover, the duplication of services and lack of coordination between programs can lead to administrative burdens and inefficiencies.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the lives of the aristocracy during this period.  However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this traditional mold by incorporating elements of mystery and the unusual. Through these unique narrative devices, the characters in both novels are more deeply developed, providing readers with a better understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\nOne notable example of this can be seen in the mind-bending passage from a scene in Oliver Twist, where the protagonist finds himself caught up in a chaotic and disorienting sequence of events. The scene describes how the main character's thoughts become increasingly jumbled, and he finds himself reliving the traumatic experience of a shooting, which is portrayed as a dream-like state. This sequence highlights Oliver's lack of control over the circumstances surrounding the shooting and the severe toll it has taken on his health. As his senses become numb, the pain and fear become a constant presence, leaving the reader questioning whose actions led to his misfortune. This scene suggests that Oliver has been worn down and is struggling to cope, implying that he has lost the will to fight for control over his life.\n\nSimilarly, a passage from another scene in Oliver Twist describes a day that seems to blend into night, characterized by an eerie silence and a sense of time passing rapidly. This atmosphere of despair is a common thread throughout the novel, as Oliver's experiences continue to weigh heavily on him.",
            "About two years ago, I worked at an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students in various subjects, but I specialized in English and reading. I was approached by an instructor to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading despite being in the third or fourth grade. I was puzzled by his difficulties, as he found some letters easy to pronounce while others were almost impossible for him. This caught my attention, and I soon discovered that Adrian's mother, who only spoke Spanish, was present during our sessions. We managed to communicate using a basic understanding of Spanish, but it was then that I realized Adrian's issue was not with reading, but with knowing the English alphabet.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenges posed by language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It is often not immediately apparent, even for students who speak fluent English, as in Adrian's case. This issue affects many students, and finding a solution is not straightforward. In Adrian's situation, addressing his problem was relatively simple – he needed extra help with English reading, particularly with the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and other methods on their own are insufficient to address the issue. Instead, a combination of these approaches is necessary. \n\nThe dual language system, which is often viewed as a resource-intensive idea, is actually beneficial for all students. Research has shown that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that this approach may not be effective for the majority of students, the reality is that it can benefit all students if implemented widely. However, implementing this system in classrooms requires careful consideration. It is not necessary for all teachers to be bilingual, as that would be unrealistic and impractical. Instead, schools can employ specialized aids, tutors, or support staff who are fluent in multiple languages to help students who need it.",
            "From an early age, many of us are led to believe that there is something greater than ourselves that we can't fully understand. Some people attend church, temple, or explore their own spirituality, while others accept the faith passed down by their parents or reject it entirely. Whatever path we choose, we are on a journey of self-discovery through our individual perspectives on spirituality, searching for guidance and meaning in life. \n\nThis introspection was reflected in a conversation I once had with my father, when I asked him about his favorite type of bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the sound of rain on the tin roof, as the rain poured down the gutters and washed away the plants along the edge of the porch. My father gazed out into the rain, lost in thought, his health visibly declining over the past few months. He seemed disconnected, and I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I was going to miss him, as acknowledging it would make the reality even harder to bear. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in looking out into the rain, trying to find a sense of comfort in the shared moment.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. Although the chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the doctors' predictions, they failed to ease his suffering. I couldn't help but question the value of prolonging his life, wondering what kind of higher power would allow this to happen. Alone at night, I didn't pray, as I had lost faith in a higher being that would listen. \n\nI had chosen not to witness his passing, unable to watch the person who created me leave this world. Instead, I chose to remember my father through the happy memories of his life, not the agony of his death. I also knew that he wouldn't have wanted me to be present during his final moments, so I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for news of his passing. Unfortunately, no one even reached out to me during that difficult time.",
            "Ian Watt describes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its contradictory nature. The Gothic mode has been both criticized for lacking depth and praised for its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime.' Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the original Gothic novel, drew upon the ideas of both ancient and modern romances to create a new genre and literary style. By combining old theatrical elements with modern narrative techniques, Walpole created a unique form of expression, which he referred to as \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic genre often incorporates elements of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the term \"Gothic\" being associated with different peoples, styles, and time periods during the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication. As a result, the term \"Gothic\" was often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements. However, the blending of the theatrical aspects of Gothic literature with the novel's format, which allows readers to delve into the characters' psychologies, has enabled the Gothic genre to endure and remain relevant despite being both old and new to readers.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry, which is derived from medieval ideals of knighthood. In The Castle of Otranto, this concept is both preserved and transformed. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, as it represented the ideal of the brave, honorable, and competent knight. By idealizing and romanticizing the chivalric past, Gothic writers aimed to critique the present and suggest improvements. Walpole, writing during a tumultuous period, was disillusioned with the potential future and possibly felt that the moral and innate goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This sentiment is reflected in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits and is described as a gallant and courteous prince who has suffered nobly.",
            "Supply chain management is a series of interconnected processes that oversee the movement of goods from raw materials to customers, encompassing stages such as production, supply, and distribution. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling the flow of goods to meet customer demands efficiently. Six key components underpin supply chain management: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial stage in the supply chain process, serving as its foundation. It involves defining the when, why, where, and how of production, based on market analysis and customer demand. To gain insights into customer needs, managers analyze market trends, which provide valuable indicators of demand. With a thorough understanding of customer requirements, managers determine the products to produce, their quantities, and the most suitable production locations, taking into account factors like volume and quality. Once production locations are identified, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Every detail in the production process is crucial, as any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses in the long run. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed detailed guides and processes to ensure smooth operations and minimize confusion among employees.\n\nThe second critical element in supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process, and may also opt to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to provide high-quality products while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "A chilling message reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" on a sign held by Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, as she stands alone on a street corner. The sign's contents are a reference to Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962. In 2007, mass street protests erupted, led by Burmese monks donning saffron-colored robes, sparking the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the public began to take notice of the protests, but the situation soon escalated into a violent conflict between the military junta and the monks, with foreign journalists, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, being violently suppressed. According to Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, the actual death toll from the protests is much higher than the reported 13 fatalities, with estimates suggesting thousands of victims.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. The desire to suppress dissent and maintain control has been a recurring theme throughout human history. From the Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule to Japanese emperors being believed to be divine leaders, there are numerous examples of governments attempting to exert total control over their citizens. Even in modern times, world leaders have been known to engage in similar tactics, such as having secret meetings with influential figures. History is replete with instances of brutal crackdowns on dissent, including the infamous 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where estimates of deaths range from several hundred to over 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and moderates, and the atrocities committed during Hitler's reign, which resulted in the systematic persecution and murder of Jews, are other stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz stems from his extended career and his ability to shape his orchestra creatively. While he often took a subtle approach on the piano in his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and complex pieces that showcased the unique abilities of each band member. By designing a framework that allowed for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated phrases that highlighted the distinct styles of individual musicians, Ellington successfully emphasized the ensemble's overall tone while producing coherent and original soundscapes for each piece. His mastery of the distinct sounds of his players and how they blended together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking jazz compositions in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes that Ellington's innovative approach to sound and voice is exemplified in Creole Love Call, which showcases the use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early example demonstrates Ellington's ability to incorporate voice to add texture and depth without lyrics, as well as his skill in complementing the styles of his soloists. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece Creole Love Call is structured into six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response pattern between the voice and reeds, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone before transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody while emphasizing extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in the high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between the voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the 'growl' technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color in Creole Love Call is a characteristic that pervades his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ability to identify and incorporate tone color. A call-and-response phrase between 'Bubber' Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by combining the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe 'Tricky Sam' Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had long harbored an unfulfilled craving that had been with her since her teenage years, dating back to when she was 14. This yearning persisted even after three years, when she was 17, and had evolved from a desire for possessions to a longing for a specific person. However, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys who had shown attention, and their attempts to woo her had only resulted in awkward encounters. This unusual situation left her wondering what could be the cause of her unshakeable desire, a question that had been plaguing her for years. \n\nAs a result, she had spent years pondering various theories, but none were convincing enough to provide her with any conclusive answers. Despite this, she continued to navigate life, raising more questions about her desires.\n\nOrdinarily, her home life was peaceful. Her parents were calm and composed individuals who rarely argued with each other, and even less frequently with their daughter. However, they did occasionally disagree about her desire for independence and her strong, outgoing personality, which was a stark contrast to their calm demeanor. This unique blend of her lively personality and kind nature made her very likable.\n\nBut today was not a typical day at home. As she moved from room to room in search of inspiration, she was startled by a short scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's voice. She rushed into the room, panic rising as she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Upon entering, she saw her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain and repeatedly saying \"Ow\" between short breaths. The daughter quickly rushed to her side and placed a hand on her to offer assistance. With her mother's words laced with urgency, she repeatedly pleaded, \"Ouch, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The daughter understood that her mother was in immense pain and swiftly organized her response, \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up.\" Her mother directed her, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the training she had received, which enabled her to lift her mother and carry her to the car.\n\nA visit to the hospital revealed the overwhelming scents of disinfectant and illness, accompanied by an air of fear. However, the daughter was too preoccupied with helping her mother to notice it. She quickly moved her mother to the hospital bed, called for the doctors, and waited anxiously as they arrived. The medical staff quickly assessed her mother's condition, and the daughter was left to sit and worry.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had fallen from a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet, causing her injury.",
            "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean diet, as reflected by the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed) score, emphasizes high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol intake allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower total and cardiovascular mortality. However, no prior research had explored the specific relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke. This study drew on data from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses, to investigate this connection.\n\nThe research analyzed data from 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated the aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. The study found that over 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period. The validity of the food frequency questionnaires was confirmed through validation studies.\n\nThe study identified reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke through medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and represent long-term dietary intake, the study calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated food frequency questionnaires. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke. The results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women.\n\nOver the 20-year follow-up period, the study identified 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a significantly lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States experienced a severe financial crisis in 2007. This crisis led to a sharp increase in unemployment, a collapse of the housing market, and the downfall of several prominent American corporations. Given the ongoing impact of this crisis, it's essential to examine its causes and explore ways to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The root of the crisis lies in the reckless and uninformed decisions made by policymakers, which forced banks and financial institutions to issue large numbers of subprime loans to the already fragile financial system. This was further exacerbated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were compelled to purchase and repackage these high-risk mortgages into complex financial instruments. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, the banks faced a significant shortage of capital reserves, causing a ripple effect that spread to the broader economy through the repackaged mortgages they had sold.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton administration, which aimed to increase the President's popularity ahead of his re-election bid. To achieve this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, paving the way for the subsequent subprime crisis seven years later. According to a 1999 article by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure to expand lending to low- and moderate-income households while maintaining its profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that this approach could lead to trouble in the event of an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to the one that saved the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the warnings were ignored, leading to the devastating economic consequences that unfolded.\n\nThe use of complex financial instruments, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, further entangled the economy with the housing market. This led to households and financial markets becoming excessively dependent on the housing market, making them highly vulnerable to even minor changes in prices. The housing bubble eventually burst, causing devastating consequences for financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities. The top U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a low price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to adopt commercial banking models subject to stricter regulations. Fannie and Freddie had accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition section of a story - a place where writers either take to the skies with their imagination or face the wrath of readers who lose interest. Dr. Merlin has been known to get frustrated when she finds herself bogged down in too much detail, and it's not the kind of excitement she was aiming for.\n\nAs writers, we've all heard the advice to \"show, don't tell,\" but it's easy to get caught up in lengthy passages of exposition that don't add much to the plot. It's as if there's a pesky inner voice urging us to get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff. However, this isn't the same as the voice that whispers to reveal character details through action and dialogue.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the reader what's happened, usually in a straightforward manner. In film, it often takes the form of one character spewing out a vast amount of information, like a verbal dump. In writing, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine being told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and had her husband brutally murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with the couple only having a couple of lines of dialogue between them. Instead, you'd want the author to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his love for her through his words and actions. You'd also want to see how the heroine's life changed with him and how she felt about him, especially if the story later highlights this connection. A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character, allowing you to feel her pain when he dies and become more connected to her.\n\nIn essence, you're looking for substance to accompany the basic storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your task to provide that depth. Sometimes, it's tempting to rush through certain details, like introducing a new character with a laundry list of background information, such as his past in the Air Force, his current job, his marriages, and his secret dreams. However, this approach can leave the reader disengaged.",
            "I watched two live newscasts from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The first one, broadcast by NBC 4, covered a developing story about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife. Although the victim's name was not mentioned, a mugshot of Hostettler was shown, depicting a menacing appearance. The segment lasted only two minutes, which seemed adequate given the ongoing nature of the story. The details provided included the fact that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody.\n\nThe following story reported a shooting incident involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, who was left critically injured. No arrests had been made at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. Notably, this story seemed brief, and it's possible that the racial bias observed in the media's coverage may have contributed to this. It has been a recurring observation that when a minority is a victim of a crime, they may not receive the same level of attention as a white victim.\n\nThe next story focused on a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators believed the incident occurred in a specific location and determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle caused the damage. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nA story about the weekend weather forecast followed, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon with temperatures ranging from the mid to low 80s. The segment was relatively short, likely intended as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a suspect described as a dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie and approximately six feet tall and 150 pounds, was sought. It was observed that an unusual emphasis was placed on the suspect's racial description.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Notably, instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the newscast mentioned 300 months. It's unclear whether this was intended to convey a harsher sentence or simply to provide a different numerical representation. The newscast also identified Rodriguez as a Hispanic man, although this detail seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A profound bond exists between brothers, one that is unbreakable and irreversible. This bond is a complex tapestry of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, which are intertwined and often contradictory. The connection between brothers is deeper and more profound than any other relationship, allowing them to see themselves in each other in a way that transcends external perceptions. In moments of crisis, the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether it is marked by good or evil. When these emotions are fully expressed, they come with significant consequences, making it essential to understand and navigate the intricacies of this fraternal link. When one brother can look at the other and see their own reflection, they gain insight into their own character, not as others see them, but as they truly are, through their actions and their consequences. \n\nThis theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis\" through the complex relationships between two brothers. Against the backdrop of a vividly described environment, these two boys embark on a perilous journey, marked by the intense emotions that accompany their bond. The novel portrays the protagonist's and his brother's struggles, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the depth of their feelings and their impact on the protagonist's actions. The story is centered around the protagonist's emotional journey, driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. As he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, the protagonist feels a growing sense of resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who would be his partner in exploration and adventure, but Doodle's frail health, born from a weak heart, makes it impossible for him to participate in the activities that the protagonist had dreamed of. This reality is crushing for the young protagonist, and he is even shown to harbor anger towards Doodle. However, when Doodle smiles, the protagonist's anger gives way to a deep affection, revealing that his love for his brother is a fundamental aspect of his nature. This ambivalence showcases the complexity of the protagonist's emotions and highlights the inherent contradictions that arise from this unique bond.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative system that processes information. As technology has evolved, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a clay tablet, then to a scroll, then to a book, and more recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these comparisons have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions. \n\nInformation processing commences with sensory organs converting physical stimuli into electrical signals. This sensory information undergoes multiple transformations within the brain through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, initial processing involves combining basic elements such as color, orientation, and the object's borders to determine what you see. Subsequent processing utilizes previous decisions to speed up recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to some extent, an attention filter determines its significance and which cognitive processes should have access to it. Although your brain analyzes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy environment. There are various stages of processing, and the results are influenced by attention in a cyclical manner.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, often depending on the type of sensory stimulus it originated from. For instance, verbal input can be encoded in a visual, auditory, or semantic manner. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal passing through a particular sequence of neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved through the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, each based on different disciplines such as human memory retrieval, computer science, or neurophysiology. One such model is the semantic network, where concepts are represented as nodes linked based on their relationships. For example, in this model, the concept of a \"chair\" could be associated with \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and the capitalistic system that perpetuates it in his novel Brave New World. In this dystopian world, individuals prioritize community over personal freedom, and from a young age, they are conditioned to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are unwittingly trapped in a larger scheme, conforming to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Under a Marxist lens, the novel reveals Huxley's concerns about the emerging systems of his time. His use of Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, underscores his commentary on the shortcomings of the economy during his era.\n\nThe novel satirically portrays capitalism through the concept of false consciousness. The common people are kept in the dark about their economic relationships with other classes, focused instead on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control over the working class and laborers, evident in the conditioning of people in Brave New World. The lower classes, ranging from Deltas to Gammas, lack true autonomy, as hypnopædia reinforces their drive for consumption and indulgence above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. The phenomenon of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over various social classes, is also evident in Brave New World, where the lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, effectively buying into an ideology that supports the capitalist structure. In contrast, the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but often choose to accept their status quo. The interactions between social classes in the novel serve as a testament to the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial and lack depth, with characters often being reduced to one-dimensional portrayals. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions, often reduced to comments about physical appearance. The societal classes' contentment with their positions in the hierarchy highlights the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, having spent four and a half semesters on campus. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in East Halls, which is situated towards the eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, located near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. Speaking with an alum who is not much older than me, I learned that the East Halls dorms were previously separated from the rest of the campus by vast expanses of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been developed with sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and health services facility, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. In such a scenario, the most effective solution is often the bicycle. Nevertheless, owning a bike is merely the first step; students must also be willing to use it, and the campus infrastructure should be designed to accommodate the needs of cyclists.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who had taken up bicycling again after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his wonder at why he had ever stopped, remarking that bicycles are an excellent mode of transportation. \"Bikes are great,\" he said. \"For a few years, it wasn't fashionable to ride a bike, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" In addition to its physical benefits, bicycling is a highly efficient way to travel, allowing you to cover 30 miles or more with minimal effort. As many of my peers do, I currently live off-campus, situated approximately the same distance from the campus center as some dorms. One of the most practical decisions I made this year was purchasing a bike. Daily classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, can be reached in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a moderate pace. However, there are challenges associated with using Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my home. While walking is also an option, I find it too time-consuming for my schedule. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, equating to over two and a half hours each week. This would leave me with insufficient time for other activities and responsibilities."
